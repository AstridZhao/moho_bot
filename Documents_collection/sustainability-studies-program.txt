Breadcrumb    Home    Academics             Sustainability will be essential to the formulation of sound environmental, economic and social progress in the 21st century. The Five College Sustainability Studies certificate (FCSS) program is designed to engage students in a structured course of study that will draw on courses from across the campuses in a range of disciplines. Students complete an internship, independent research project or advanced course work in sustainability studies.  The Five College Sustainability Studies Certificate Program is available to students at Amherst College, Hampshire College and Mount Holyoke College, and incorporates courses and other academic offerings from all five campuses. If you are interested in pursuing the certificate, please contact the certificate advisor at your campus .

Core Courses  The core courses are intended to expose students to the interconnectedness and significance of economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability. Certificate students complete one course each from three core areas:  Environmental Sustainability  Sustainable Economy and Politics  Sustainable Society and Culture  Concentration Areas  Students pursuing a Five College Certificate in Sustainability Studies must choose an area of concentration from the following five areas of study. Students complete at least three courses within their declared concentration area (at least one at the advanced level) and one other course chosen from a different concentration area.  Agriculture and Food Systems  Energy Systems, Climate and Water  Culture, History and Representation  Politics and Policy  Green Infrastructure, Design and Technology       Agriculture and Food Systems    By its very nature, food is central to society, culture, and basic survival. However, our current, predominantly industrial agricultural system takes a reductionist approach to growing food, with minimal concern for the resulting environmental, economic and societal impacts. In order to maintain our agricultural and food systems into the future, an integrated approach which takes environment, economy, and equity into account is critical. In this concentration, students will integrate the science, technology, policies, and ethics of agriculture and food systems, and will examine the relationships among agriculture, food choices, nutrition, and economic and social well-being.    Energy, Climate, and Water    More than ever before, society is coming to appreciate the complex inter-relationships between energy use, climate change, and global water availability. The production and consumption of fossil fuels is the leading source of greenhouse gases promoting climate change, which affects not only temperature but also precipitation patterns. Any effort to slow or reverse the process of global warming requires a fundamental shift to cleaner energy technology; likewise, any effort to adjust to global warming requires improved water management in order to ensure adequate water supplies. This concentration explores the changing nature of global climate and the solutions required for sustainable energy and water management in the 21st century.    Culture, History, and Representation    Nature was once autonomous but at least for the past fifty thousand years, humans have dramatically affected nature. We cannot understand and promote sustainability without understanding the ways humans have constructed nature, both symbolically and materially. Indeed, the social construction of both nature and sustainability has given rise to conflicts over meaning and policy in the wake of growing environmental awareness and activism. This history has often been portrayed as elegy--what we have lost. But we also have to acknowledge what we have gained. This concentration invites students to explore the tension between notions of progress and loss, a tension which itself promotes the desire for sustainability. It challenges the student to consider the constitutive role of culture in defining nature and sustainability across a range of public discourses and practices.    Politics and Policy    In many parts of today's world, people and environments suffer from ecological degradation, resource scarcity, economic decline and social exploitation -- none of which promotes sustainability. Transitioning to sustainability will require societal and political action at local, regional, national, international and global levels. In some cases, new norms, laws, treaties and institutions will need to be crafted and enforced in order to improve environmental and other standards. In other cases, people whose livelihood practices sustain and depend on human and ecological communities may challenge policies and political systems that favor environmental and social exploitation. The politics of sustainability will be full of contest and conflict, but it carries the transformative potential to build a far better world. This concentration will examine the role of governments, businesses, non-governmental organizations, community groups and others in devising, supporting, fighting over, negotiating and enacting sustainable policies and practices.    Green Infrastructure, Design, and Technology    For the first time in history, more than half the world’s population now lives in cities. A sustainable future for 7 billion people therefore requires sustainable urban systems, buildings and infrastructure. The aim of this concentration is to provide a broad understanding of the challenges, strategies and opportunities that face modern society as we seek to move toward more sustainable built environments. The concentration includes the study and practice of design, as well as planning policy. The course selections and project work in this concentration will examine the interrelationships between urban design and planning, ecosystem processes, green building technologies, policy-making and social equity.      Experiential Component  Students work with their campus program advisor to identify and complete an internship or independent research project that addresses a contemporary, “real world” problem.  Alternatively, students may work with their program advisor to identify a suitable advanced course within their concentration area. An approved internship, independent research project or upper-level course within the area of concentration may be counted toward fulfillment of the advanced course requirement.  Capstone Presentation  Advanced certificate students present work at a Five College symposium or other venue to consider the ways in which the student's work addresses the core areas of sustainability and their linkages.     Certificate Planning & Completion Form              Courses    Many courses in addition to those listed below may be eligible for fulfilling the requirements of the Five College Sustainability Studies Certificate. Students are encouraged to consult a Sustainability Studies Program campus advisor to identify courses that are appropriate for their interests.

Frequently Asked Questions      Can students at each of the Five Colleges obtain the FCCS certificate?    No. At this time, the certificate is available only to Amherst College, Hampshire College and Mount Holyoke College students.    Are there specific areas that the FCSS Certificate focuses on?    Yes. Elective concentration areas are:  Agriculture and Food Systems  Energy, Climate and Water  Culture, History and Representation  Politics and Policy  Green Infrastructure, Design and Technology.     Is the certificate only course based?    No. Students must also complete an internship or independent research project that addresses a real world problem related to sustainability.    Do I need to formally say that I intend to work toward the FCSS Certificate?    Yes. Students will give their campus program advisor a Declaration of Intent, outlining a potential course of study, by the second semester of their sophomore year. The actual application for the certificate will be submitted later; students should work with their campus advisors to decide when that would be.    Some of the courses I wish to use for the FCSS Certificate are not listed on the website. Can I substitute courses?    Possibly. Students must work with their campus advisors on this. It will be important to explain how each individual unlisted course meets the requirement.    Who decides whether my application for the FCSS Certificate is successful?    As with many of the other Five College certificates, a committee composed of Five College faculty makes this decision.    How can the FCSS Certificate help me?    Having the certificate may well help you obtain a job or internship after you graduate. In addition, the certificate is designed to guide students who are trying to develop a course of studies in sustainability.               Resources    Each of the campuses pays a great deal of attention to sustainable approaches to operations such as cogeneration power plants, green buildings, transportation, sustainable dining and other exciting initiatives.
