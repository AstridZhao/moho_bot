Option II: a 44 credit option that does not lead to teacher licensure. We also offer a minor in education with teacher licensure. The minor in education with teacher licensure provides another route to completing the coursework necessary for applying to Mount Holyoke’s teacher licensure program. There is no major in education. Psychology and Education Faculty    Teacher Licensure Program           Program Overview    If you are considering pursuing teacher licensure while an undergraduate at Mount Holyoke you will need to contact the Five College Teacher Licensure Coordinator for an appointment (preferably by the middle of your sophomore year), to review your options, the licensure requirements, and application procedures for acceptance into the licensure program of your choice. As a candidates for any of Mount Holyoke’s teacher education programs, you must complete a sequence of courses in the Psychology and Education Department prior to the spring semester of your senior year. The spring semester of your senior year will be devoted almost entirely to the practicum, which is a full-time student teaching assignment in an area school. Several options are available to complete the teacher licensure course sequence in relation to your major or minor:  If you wish to work towards an early childhood or elementary license you have a choice of majors. You can major in psychology and education or, with careful selection of courses, any liberal arts major the College offers. Most students who major in something other than psychology and education elect to complete the education with teacher licensure minor because it provides the course work necessary for applying to Mount Holyoke’s teacher licensure programs. If you wish to pursue a license in middle or secondary school subjects or certification in the arts , you will typically major in that subject area, with careful selection of courses to meet all licensure requirements. We encourage you to visit the teacher licensure program and to contact the Teacher Licensure Coordinator for further information. If you have already completed a bachelor's degree, the Master of Arts in Teaching program, through the Professional and Graduate Education division, offers a route towards licensure.

After the 100 level course, you will move on to Statistics (Psychology 201) and then Research Methods (Psychology 200), either of which can be taken at the same time as other 200 level courses. Courses and Requirements           Learning Goals  Major Requirements  Minor Requirements  Courses      Learning Goals        Learning Goals  By participating in coursework and experiences constituting a major in Psychology and Education, students will acquire the following knowledge and skills:  Through introductory courses, students will gain a comprehensive overview of the field of psychology, the intersections among sub-fields, and the connections among theory, research, and practice (including both classic and cutting-edge questions and problems within the field). Through core courses such as statistics and research methods, students will learn a variety of research approaches (both quantitative and qualitative), develop technological skills and facility with a variety of software, and become fluent in the ethical issues involved in human and non-human research. Through intermediate and advanced courses, students will learn how to read primary sources of psychological and educational research (both contemporary and historical), and learn how to analyze underlying assumptions, apply theoretical frameworks, and evaluate the validity of empirical evidence. From the curricular offerings, students will understand how psychological and educational questions and research may reflect gender, race, and social class biases and learn innovative ways of applying theory and research to critical social issues. Through our unique focus on research and independent study, students will have opportunities to develop skills as articulate writers and speakers and will gain additional research experience through participation in research projects with distinguished department faculty.
