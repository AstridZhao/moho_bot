Apollonius of Rhodes,Argonautica; Ovid,MetamorphosesandHeroides; Greek tragedy, and ancient images representing myths.Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesP.DebnarRestrictions: This course is limited to first-years and sophomores.Advisory: Juniors and seniors should contact the professor for permission.Notes: Taught in English.Optional screenings of films related to ancient myth.CLASS-212  Greek Tragedy, American Drama, and FilmSpring.Credits: 4The Greeks, beginning with Homer, saw the world from an essentially tragic perspective.The searing question of why human societies and the human psyche repeatedly break down in tragic ruin and loss, particularly in the conflicts of war and in the betrayal of personal bonds of love and friendship, fascinated them as it still does us.The most consistent themes that emerged from such examination are the tragedy of self-knowledge and illusion, the tragedy of desire, the tragedy of crime and guilt, and tragedy as a protest against social injustice.This course examines the critical influence of the three most important Athenian dramatists, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, on the works of Nobel winner Eugene O'Neill, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller and important filmmakers, who have tried to recreate the powerful atmosphere and impact of the Greek tragic theater or reworked the tragic themes of classical myth for their own purposes in the modern age.Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesOther Attribute(s): Writing-IntensiveB.ArnoldCLASS-226  Bread and Circuses: The Politics of Public Entertainment in Ancient RomeNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4Bread and circuses (panem et circenses) was a catchphrase in the Roman empire that described the political strategy of controlling an unruly populace through free bread and public entertainment.Against a backdrop of Roman social and political institutions, this course focuses on the imperial ideology, aristocratic ethos, and cultural practices that underpinned this catchphrase, as well as questions concerning the careers of entertainers--gladiators, charioteers, and actors--who were at once celebrities and social outcasts; the rules of spectatorship at the games; the use of these games as a form of social control; and the logistics of feeding the city population.Crosslisted as:HIST-226Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesG.SumiCLASS-227  Ancient GreeceNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4This course will trace the emergence and expansion of Greek civilization in the Mediterranean between the Bronze Age and Alexander the Great.Among themes to be explored are political structures, trade, slavery, gender relations, and religion, as well as the contributions of ancient Greeks to literary genres (drama, rhetoric, historiography, philosophy) and to the visual arts.Throughout we will consider how the history of the ancient Greeks can speak to modern concerns.Sources will include works of ancient Greek literature and history (e.g., Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides, Aristophanes, Plutarch) as well as archaeological and epigraphic evidence.Crosslisted as:HIST-227Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesG.SumiCLASS-228  Ancient RomeNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4Ancient Rome and its empire can be viewed both as a measure of human achievement and a cautionary tale of the corrupting effects of unbridled power.This course covers the history of Ancient Rome from its mythologized beginnings (753 BCE) to the rise and spread of Christianity under the Emperor Constantine (312 CE).Topics include the creation and development of Rome's republican form of government as well as its eventual transition to monarchy, the causes and consequences of the acquisition of empire, the role of the army in administering the provinces and defending the frontiers, the image of emperor, the economy, and religion.Crosslisted as:HIST-228Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesG.SumiCLASS-229  The Tyrant and Gladiator: Bad Roman Emperors from Caligula to CommodusNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4Caligula was a god (or so he thought); Nero fiddled while Rome burned; Commodus dressed as a gladiator and fought man and beast in the arena.The history of the Roman empire is replete with scandalous stories about eccentric and even insane emperors whose reigns raise questions about the nature of the emperor's power and his role in administering the empire.In this course a close study of Roman imperial biography and historiography--the source of so many of these stories of bad emperors--will be weighed against documentary and archaeological evidence in order to reveal the dynamic between the emperor, his court, and his subjects that was fundamental to the political culture of imperial Rome.Crosslisted as:HIST-229Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesG.SumiCLASS-239  Topics in ClassicsCLASS-239HE  Topics in Classics: "The Hellenistic World from Alexander to Cleopatra'Fall.Credits: 4An introduction to the history and legends of Alexander the Great and Cleopatra VII through an analysis of the surviving historical and literary evidence.By spreading Greek culture from northern Greece as far as modern Pakistan, Alexander transformed much of the known world, which witnessed changes in politics and imperialism, literature and science, as well as in the lives of women.This diverse and dynamic world produced Cleopatra VII who endeavored to preserve her dynasty amid the growing power of the Roman Empire.This course concludes with the enduring legacies of Alexander and Cleopatra in modern times.Crosslisted as:HIST-253HEApplies to requirement(s): HumanitiesG.SumiCLASS-239RA  Topics in Classics: 'Roman Art and Archaeology'Fall.Credits: 4This course provides an introduction to the art, architecture, and archaeology of the ancient Romans.At its height, the Roman Empire controlled much of the ancient Mediterranean.As Roman power spread, so too did Rome's art and architecture.This course examines the major developments in Roman archaeology from the foundation of Rome through the growing Republic of Pompey and Caesar, the Rome of the emperors, and the rise of Christianity.We will explore how material culture, from tombs and temples in Rome to the urban planning of provincial cities, can help us to better understand the connections between material culture and history, politics, religion, and daily life in the Roman world.Crosslisted as:ARTH-290RAApplies to requirement(s): HumanitiesC.BakerCLASS-239VA  Topics in Classics: 'Ancient Greek Vases and Vase Painting'Spring.Credits: 4Greek painted vases are some of the most recognizable artifacts from the ancient Mediterranean.In this course, we will situate Greek vases and the scenes painted on them within Greek culture and its artistic production.We explore these vases, produced from the Minoan period through the Hellenistic age, from a variety of perspectives.Themes will include the artisans and workshops who produced these vases, the consumers -- from ancient buyers to modern museums -- who purchased them, the traders who moved them, the variety of styles and scenes, from mythological to daily life scenes, which decorated them, and the approaches to these vessels employed by current and past scholarsCrosslisted as:ARTH-290VAApplies to requirement(s): HumanitiesC.BakerCLASS-242  Sicily: Crossroads of the MediterraneanSpring.Credits: 4Its long history as the locus of collisions among cultures -- Greek, Roman, Arab, Norman, Spanish, and (northern) Italian -- has earned Sicily a special place in Mediterranean studies.One product of these clashes is that for millennia Sicilians have confronted questions of identity.More recently, because of immigration waves from North Africa, Sicily is once again at the center of the Mediterranean cultural debate.This course will cover almost three thousand years of Sicilian life, as we explore the role of material culture and literature in shaping Sicilian identities.Readings (with related films) may include selections from such authors as Virgil, and Ovid; Ibn Hawkal and Al-Idrisi; Lampedusa, Pirandello, Giordana, and Maraini.Crosslisted as: ITAL-242Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesP.Debnar, O. FrauNotes: Taught in EnglishCLASS-253  The Spartans: Myth and HistoryNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4In contrast to democratic Athens, oligarchic Sparta was renowned for its secrecy and skillful use of propaganda.Thus, it presents difficult challenges for historical study.In this course we will try to peer behind the "Spartan mirage" to determine how much the Spartans really differed from other ancient Greeks.We will then try to understand the use of Spartans as models for later polities and for groups like the Nazis and Alt-right.Topics: government, education, and citizenship; the role of women, eugenics, and slavery; the use and misuse of the image of Sparta.Readings will include Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, and modern scholarship on specific topics.Crosslisted as:HIST-253SPApplies to requirement(s): HumanitiesP.DebnarNotes: With permission of the instructor, this course may be taken by juniors and seniors for 300-level credit in Classics.CLASS-260  Knowing GodNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4This course examines the following key texts from the ancient world that treat significantly the problem of knowing God and the mystery enveloping such knowledge: Sophocles'Oedipus the King, Plato'sPhaedo, Cicero'sConcerning the Nature of the Gods,Job, Paul'sEpistle to the Romans, and others.Attention is also given to the different ways of thinking about the divine and human natures in these works, which are broadly reflective of Graeco-Roman and Judaeo-Christian value systems.Crosslisted as:RELIG-225KGApplies to requirement(s): HumanitiesB.ArnoldCLASS-262  Kingdoms Human and DivineNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4How political authority is wielded is a theme of some of the greatest works in the Greco-Roman philosophical tradition: Plato'sRepublic, Aristotle'sPolitics, and Augustine'sCity of God.Authority exercised well gives rise to good order and human flourishing, but abusive authority results in the opposite: injustice, conflict, and ultimately destructive violence.In this course we will compare how these philosophers addressed the problem of political authority in the human realm with the theme of the kingdom of God in the Bible, especially as found inThe Gospel of MatthewandThe Book of Revelation.Crosslisted as:RELIG-225KHApplies to requirement(s): HumanitiesB.ArnoldCLASS-295  Independent StudyFall and Spring.Credits: 1 -
