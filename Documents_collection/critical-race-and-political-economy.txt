Critical Race and Political Economy Faculty           Program Overview    The Department of Critical Race and Political Economy’s (CRPE) curriculum cultivates an understanding of how race, colonialism, and other systems of power have structured human lives and their environments on local, national, and global scales. CRPE students explore how race has informed the imagination of social transformation, justice, and liberation in the past and present. CRPE approaches “race” as a shifting relation  through which power and domination are rationalized, but also a foundation on which struggles for liberation and self-determination are waged.  CRPE is an interdisciplinary department that sustains a collaborative curriculum that builds upon the integrity of Africana Studies, Latinx Studies, and critical social thought. At a time of tremendous social and political upheaval in the US and around the world, CRPE is grounded in critical race theory and the interdisciplinary traditions of Black feminism, ethnic  studies, queer and trans* critique, migration and border studies, disability justice, abolitionism, and decolonial praxis. Our curriculum approaches political economy as a basis for critical engagement with liberal conceptions of property, individualism, and rights. This critical standpoint informs interdisciplinary, intersectional analyses of the role that borders, prisons, military bases, urban infrastructures, and rural extraction zones play in the structural management of populations deemed surplus to the global economy. Also central to the curriculum are critical and creative engagements with art and expressive cultures, which reimagine dominant histories, record structures of feeling, and envision radical futures.  CRPE is guided by the principle that interdisciplinary research and thinking are at the core of cutting-edge liberal arts scholarship. Bridging the humanities, social sciences, and sciences, the curriculum interrogates the constitution of knowledge and the construction of social categories outside of the confines of traditional disciplinary boundaries. The department  incorporates a problem-solving methodology, which will allow for student-driven inquiry and research that combines social, cultural, and political critique with a concern for addressing  pressing global and local issues. Given the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of our student body, our curriculum will also enable students to connect their identities with critical frameworks that address social positioning in diverse historical and geographical contexts.

Credits: 4   This course examines the relationship between the urban and Latina/o/x placemaking, identities and culture(s). Urban scholars have long studied the "evolving" city-this course explores the changing city in relation to Latina/o/x populations and urban social change movements. We examine historical and contemporary conditions and cover a broad range of topics including: urbanization, urban planning, "new urbanism," placemaking, gentrification, migration/immigration, segregation, and more. The readings in this course aim to provoke a consideration of the dynamic between space and place, as well as how urban life, culture, and form impacts Latina/o/x populations and vice versa.

CRPE-308  Luminous Darkness: African American Social Thought After DuBois  Spring. Credits: 4   Examines the life, work, and legacies of WEB DuBois. Drawing on domestic and diasporic fictional and nonfictional meditations on black life and progress in and beyond the 'DuBoisian century,' the course considers the changing meanings of and movements for global racial justice for people of African descent. The course also confronts the globalization of the color line in the post-Civil Rights/Black Power era. Due to increasing precarity for the masses, emphasis is given to more recent ideas like afro-pessimism, racial capitalism, and afro-futurism, as contemporary responses to DuBois's 1903 question, 'How does it feel to be a problem?' Readings by Jemisin, Gyasi, Robinson, Fields, Butler, Davis, Ransby, Hartman, Wilderson, Fanon, YamahttaTaylor, among others form the core of the course.

Rosa  CRPE-356  Latinas/os/x and Housing: Mi Casa Is Not Su Casa  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   Housing is closely tied to quality of life and the health of neighborhoods and communities. As a main goal of the "American Dream," homeownership has important significance on an individual and societal level. For immigrants, this goal is often out of reach as a result of racism and discriminatory housing policies. This interdisciplinary seminar explores Latinas/os/x relationship to housing and homeownership by examining the history of exclusionary housing policies in the United States. By exploring a range of topics (affordability, ownership, gentrification, etc), we will develop a sharper understanding of why housing is one of the most pressing issues for Latinas/os/x today.

Credits: 4   This course will be an interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary exploration of grassroots organizing, community experiences, and social movements from 1700 to the present day by highlighting how community organizing has been affected by socio-structural problems and, in the words of Patricia Hill Collins, "the matrix of oppression"; but also by critically analyzing the historical contributions of grassroots organizations to dismantling all systems of domination. We will track how various organizations and social movements have understood, challenged, contested, and transformed power hierarchies. Simultaneously we will enter the history of community organizing in the United States of America and interrogate how multidimensional processes of racialization, gender classification, class, and sexual division inform experiences within and around these social movements.

Credits: 4   This course will center the activism, theories and praxis of abolition feminism. We will collectively study how interpersonal violence (gender, racial, sexual, ableist) is intertwined with state violence (from domestic policing to militarism abroad). Through investigating the legal history of the criminalization of survivors alongside mainstream antiviolence research and statistics, we will challenge the use of criminological binaries such as victim/perpetrator and violent/nonviolent. Partnering with coalitions like Survived and Punished National, this course is structured by a series of anti-carceral action research projects such as contributing to active survivor defense campaigns.
