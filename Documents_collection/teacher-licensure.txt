in that subject area.For example, students pursuing a license in middle school mathematics would major in mathematics; students pursuing a license in secondary school history would major in history.In addition, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education requires knowledge of specific subject matter within each major.It's important to consult withMs.Sarah Frenette, the Five College Teacher Licensure Coordinator, early on in your academic career to review subject matter knowledge requirements.Students who wish to work towards an early childhood or elementary license have a choice of majors.Students can major in Psychology and Education or any liberal arts major which the College offers.For example, students can major in art, history, psychology, environmental studies, women studies, etc.In addition, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education requires knowledge of specific subject matter within the early childhood or elementary levels.Check withMs.Sarah Frenette, the Five College Teacher Licensure Coordinator, for the self assessment form appropriate for your chosen level.Applying to the practicum semesterCompleted applications are due January 7 of the junior year.Application materialsare available online.Once all application materials are submitted, candidates will be contacted for an interview with one of the program directors.As part of the application process, candidates must also complete the Communication and Literacy Skills test of the Massachusetts Tests for Educator Licensure (MTEL) prior to February of their junior year.A Practicum Selection Committee examines these documents along with evaluation and self evaluation forms from the field based experiences.Students are notified prior to spring advising week of

Department prior to the spring semester of their senior year.The spring semester of the senior year is devoted almost entirely to the practicum, which is a full-time student teaching assignment in an area school.This sequence of psychology and education courses can also fulfill requirements for an education minor.See the Psychology and Education course requirements (listed here) that are necessary for licensure in the following programs: Early Childhood Education Program, Elementary Education Program and Middle/Secondary/Visual Art/Dance/Theater and Music Programs.In some instances course work in a major coincides with course work required for licensure; in other cases, it does not.For specific course requirements for licensure within your chosen major, please consult the chair of the department and your advisor.Learning GoalsMajor RequirementsMinor RequirementsCoursesLearning GoalsLearning GoalsBy participating in coursework and experiences constituting a major in Psychology and Education, students will acquire the following knowledge and skills:Through introductory courses, students will gain a comprehensive overview of the field of psychology, the intersections among sub-fields, and the connections among theory, research, and practice (including both classic and cutting-edge questions and problems within the field).Through core courses such as statistics and research methods, students will learn a variety of research approaches (both quantitative and qualitative), develop technological skills and facility with a variety of software, and become fluent in the ethical issues involved in human and non-human research.Through intermediate and advanced courses, students will learn how to read primary sources of psychological and educational research (both contemporary and historical), and learn how to analyze underlying assumptions, apply theoretical frameworks, and evaluate the validity of empirical evidence.From the curricular offerings, students will understand how psychological and educational questions and research may reflect gender, race, and social class biases and learn innovative ways of applying theory and research to critical social issues.Through our unique focus on research and independent study, students will have opportunities to develop skills as articulate writers and speakers and will gain additional research experience through participation in research projects with distinguished department faculty.Major RequirementsRequirements for the Major in Psychology and EducationTwo options are offered within the psychology
