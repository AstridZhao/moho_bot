Our focus will be on audio-visual media that thematizes music and music-making, from Visual Music and Silly Symphonies to Mamoru Hosoda's Belle and the video game Guitar Hero . Final projects can range from critical-analytical papers and video essays to original audio-visual creative work. Crosslisted as: FMT-330MA Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive A. Mueller Prereq: 8 credits in classroom Music or Film, Media, Theater courses including at least 4 credits at the 200 level or above.

Credits: 4   In this seminar, we encounter foundational texts, methodologies, and case studies in the field of Disability Studies in Music. Grounded in a music-historical approach (but incorporating other music studies methods), we trace how musicking across a range of time periods and traditions both represents and constructs the cultures, policies, and tropes of bodymind difference and normativity. We center music, performance, and scholarship by disabled individuals and collectives, and emphasize the intersectional nature of disability justice, while also interrogating ableism in the music industry and the academy, as well as our own embodied positionalities as music makers, scholars, and consumers. Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive A. Mueller Prereq: 8 credits in classroom Music courses including at least 4 credits at the 200 level or above. MUSIC-374  Advanced Seminar in Ethnomusicology  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   Designed for music and non-music majors, this advanced seminar examines core theoretical and methodological issues in ethnomusicology and the debates that have shaped its practice since its origins in the early twentieth century as comparative musicology. Drawing on musical traditions from different parts of the world and supplemented by workshops conducted by visiting professional musicians, the course explores the interdisciplinary approaches that inform how ethnomusicologists study the significance of music "in" and "as" culture. Topics covered will include ethnographic methods, the intersection of musicological and anthropological perspectives, the political significance of musical hybridity, applied ethnomusicology, and sound studies. Crosslisted as: ANTHR-316ET Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive B. Fairley Restrictions: Course limited to sophomores, juniors and seniors  Performance Studies  Official registration for all performance courses may only be done after successful completion of the audition process; at the audition students should be prepared to demonstrate their level of vocal or instrumental proficiency. All performance study is for academic credit. (See MUSIC-100 requirement below.) The Department of Music offers private instruction in performance studies at three levels for areas listed. Students studying privately are encouraged to elect the 50-minute lesson but may, at their own option or when advised by the instructor, enroll for the 30-minute lesson. Students will be placed according to the following order of priority: declared music majors and minors; first-, second-, and third-year students who demonstrate proficiency on their instrument at or above an upper elementary level, with order of placement determined by extent of experience and quality of performance; first-, second-, and third-year students who wish to begin their study of an instrument or voice, provided they enroll concurrently in MUSIC-100 or MUSIC-131 ; fourth-year students, with order of placement determined by extent of experience and quality of performance. Senior beginners must enroll concurrently in MUSIC-100 or MUSIC-131 . Additional fees are charged for performance study. Applied music fees, grants-in-aid, and fee exemptions are described in the Tuition and Fees chapter . No refund of fee after tenth academic day of classes. For fees, please see the department website . Students enroll with Mount Holyoke performance faculty if the instrument they wish to study is offered by the department. Enrollment is limited according to teacher availability, and permission of the instructor is required. Please consult the department for audition dates and times. Music 100 Requirement  Because the Department of Music believes students enrolled in individual performance studies should have a thorough knowledge of the rudiments of music, enrollment will be contingent on exemption from or concurrent enrollment in MUSIC-100 or MUSIC-131 regardless of whether a student is enrolled at Mount Holyoke or another Five College institution. The MUSIC-100 Exemption Examination is in two parts. In order to pass the exam, students must achieve scores of at least 75 percent on both the written and aural portions. 100 Level Performance Study  Successful completion of, or exemption from, MUSIC-100 allows up to 8 academic credits of individual performance study on one instrument at the 100 level. 200 Level Performance Study  Following successful completion of 8 credits of performance study at the 100 level on one instrument, the student automatically advances to study at the 200 level, for which there are no credit limitations. Students enrolled in study at the 200 level must participate in at least one public performance per semester. Earlier entry into the 200 level is with permission of instructor. 300 Level Performance Study  Usually taken only in the senior year. Students may advance to the 300 level of performance studies upon completion of MUSIC-332 , one history course at the 200 level, recommendation of the instructor, and permission of the department chair. Four credits are granted for each semester of performance study at the 300 level. Students enrolled in one semester of study at the 300 level will be required to prepare a half-recital or its equivalent. Students enrolled in a full year of study at the 300 level must prepare one full recital program or its equivalent. (“Equivalent”: two half-recitals, or one-half recital plus other significant public performance.) More detailed information on performance study at the 300 level is available from the Department of Music office. MUSIC-151A  Individual Performance Study: 'Piano'  Fall and Spring.
