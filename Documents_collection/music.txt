proficiency.All performance study is for academic credit.(SeeMUSIC-100requirement below.)The Department of Music offers private instruction in performance studies at three levels for areas listed.Students studying privately are encouraged to elect the 50-minute lesson but may, at their own option or when advised by the instructor, enroll for the 30-minute lesson.Students will be placed according to the following order of priority: declared music majors and minors; first-, second-, and third-year students who demonstrate proficiency on their instrument at or above an upper elementary level, with order of placement determined by extent of experience and quality of performance; first-, second-, and third-year students who wish to begin their study of an instrument or voice, provided they enroll concurrently inMUSIC-100orMUSIC-131; fourth-year students, with order of placement determined by extent of experience and quality of performance.Senior beginners must enroll concurrently inMUSIC-100orMUSIC-131.Additional fees are charged for performance study.Applied music fees, grants-in-aid, and fee exemptions are described in theTuition and Fees chapter.No refund of fee after tenth academic day of classes.For fees, please see thedepartment website.Students enroll with Mount Holyoke performance faculty if the instrument they wish to study is offered by the department.Enrollment is limited according to teacher availability, and permission of the instructor is required.Please consult the department for audition dates and times.Music 100 RequirementBecause the Department of Music believes students enrolled in individual performance studies should have a thorough knowledge of the rudiments of music, enrollment will be contingent on exemption from or concurrent enrollment inMUSIC-100orMUSIC-131regardless of whether a student is enrolled at Mount Holyoke or another Five College institution.TheMUSIC-100Exemption Examination is in two parts.In order to pass the exam, students must achieve scores of at least 75 percent on both the written and aural portions.100 Level Performance StudySuccessful completion of, or exemption from,MUSIC-100allows up to 8 academic credits of individual performance study on one instrument at the 100 level.200 Level Performance StudyFollowing successful completion of 8 credits of performance study at the 100 level on one instrument, the student automatically advances to study at the 200 level, for which there are no credit limitations.Students enrolled in study at the 200 level must participate in at least one public performance per semester.Earlier entry into the 200 level is with permission of instructor.300 Level Performance StudyUsually taken only in the senior year.Students may advance to the 300 level of performance studies upon completion ofMUSIC-332, one history course at the 200 level, recommendation of the instructor, and permission of the department chair.Four credits are granted for each semester of performance study at the 300 level.Students enrolled in one semester of study at the 300 level will be required to prepare a half-recital or its equivalent.Students enrolled in a full year of study at the 300 level must prepare one full recital program or its equivalent.(“Equivalent”: two half-recitals, or one-half recital plus other significant public performance.)More detailed
