The Five College Certificate in Middle Eastern Studies allows you to complement any disciplinary major with multidisciplinary studies and linguistic attainments.      Asian Studies Faculty           Program Overview    Language study is the core component of the major. As a student, you are expected to incorporate the humanities and the social sciences fully into your studies with classes at Mount Holyoke and the other colleges in the Five College Consortium.  Complementing course work at Mount Holyoke are extracurricular activities and study abroad programs that broaden and deepen your understanding of this region.  On campus, you will experience regional culture at many levels, including language tables and clubs, guest lectures, performing and visual arts, film, festivals, and regional cuisine. These activities are often initiated by and benefit greatly from the diverse student population of Mount Holyoke.  Most of our students spend a semester or a summer in study abroad programs to gain a deeper understanding of this region. We offer many approved Middle Eastern study abroad programs.  Middle Eastern studies majors graduate to pursue graduate studies and careers in fields as varied as education, business, NGOs, journalism, the arts, and government service.
