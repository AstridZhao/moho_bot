We use technology through our curriculum, from elementary courses to advanced seminars and all our courses focus on developing critical reading, speaking, and writing skills.  Class time focuses on interpersonal communication among students and with the instructor, and among students and German or near-native peer assistants. From the beginning, you will learn strategies for understanding German speakers in a variety of contexts, on many levels, and in diverse situations. In weekly conversation sessions, German or near-native peer assistants provide opportunities for small-group informal conversations.  First year seminars are typically offered each year and are taught in English. Topics vary.  Advanced seminars include the works of authors and thinkers such as Christa Wolf, Nietzsche, and Kafka, as well as films and music by contemporaries such as Fatih Akin and Tokio Hotel, while both investigating the impact of German history and politics on present-day society and exploring German social movements, scientific innovations, and cultural creations that have transformed world history.            Courses and Requirements    Most courses are conducted in German, except first-year seminars. Courses that satisfy the College language requirement only are designated as such. Other courses can satisfy either the language requirement or fulfill the humanities distribution requirement.

GRMST-221, GRMST-223, and GRMST-231 may be taken more than once as long as the topic is different.  3 GRMST-223 may be taken for 300-level credit, with approval of the instructor. Additional Specifications   Students entering the College in Fall 2023 who declare a German Studies major or minor and those from a previous entrance year completing these programs should expect to need some Five College classes to complete the programs. Students entering Fall 2024 or later will not have the option to declare a German Studies major or minor.    A maximum of 8 credits toward the major may include courses taught in English, such as GRMST-231 or, with permission of the department, other cross-listed topics courses at the 200 or 300 level.    As culture is constructed and expressed through language, students are expected to conduct their work in the department and as much work as possible outside the department, in the German language. The major in German studies is intended to provide a focused concentration in the language and culture of the German-speaking countries within transnational European contexts. Students achieve an advanced level of translingual and transcultural competence.    Students’ trajectory towards completing the requirements for the German major is based on their level of language proficiency when they enter Mount Holyoke. Individual course selection is to be coordinated with the chair or departmental advisor.    In conjunction with their advisors, students plan an individualized program of study suited to their interests and backgrounds. To ensure breadth of background and context, we strongly encourage students to include at least one pre-twentieth century course and to complement their German Studies major with a second major, minor, Nexus, or Five College certificate. Students may focus on a specific topic, period, or century. Courses focusing on German and/or European culture and taught in other departments or programs may be selected from such fields as anthropology, art, critical social thought, economics, environmental studies, film studies, gender studies, history, history of science, international relations, Jewish studies, music, politics, philosophy, psychology, religious studies, sociology, and theater arts.         Minor Requirements        The minor in German studies is intended to provide a focused introduction to the language and culture of German-speaking countries within a larger transnational context.

Courses        Course Advice  Most courses are conducted in German, except our seminars GRMST-205 and the various GRMST-231 seminars.  GRMST-231 topics satisfy the Humanities distribution requirement. It may also be possible to count these topics toward the German major or minor with permission of the department.  Courses that satisfy the College language requirement only are designated as such. Other courses can satisfy either the language requirement or fulfill a Humanities distribution requirement.  Advice for New Students  First-Year Seminars offered by German Studies faculty and GRMST-231 are writing-intensive courses taught in English. Both courses are open to first-year students.  Placement in German Courses  The Department of German Studies will review the course selection of all entering students, taking into consideration school and AP records together with the results of the placement exam .  All students with prior knowledge of German who plan to elect German in either semester must complete this exam carefully. Final course placement will be based on the following considerations: the student’s specific training in German, the results of the student’s online placement exam, and scheduling possibilities. Students should take the online placement exam prior to registration, if possible.  Students in Groups II–IV, as described below, are required to complete the online placement exam. Students may choose their courses according to the following guidelines, but all students are encouraged to consult with the chair of the department during the summer or upon arrival on campus. Email: kremmler@mtholyoke.edu  Group I: Students with no previous training in German, or with the equivalent of one year of study at the secondary school level, should elect GRMST-101 in the fall. GRMST-101 and GRMST-102 constitute a yearlong Elementary German course.  Group II: Students who have studied German for more than one year but for fewer than four years, or who feel they need a comprehensive review of grammar, should elect GRMST-201 . Students entering in the spring who have studied German for one or two years may choose GRMST-102 in consultation with the chair.  Group III: Students with three or four years of study in German should ordinarily elect GRMST-221 . Students with four or more years of German or extensive experience living in a German-speaking country or speaking German should ordinarily elect GRMST-223 based on the results of the placement exam.  Group IV: Other students with previous training in German should consult with the department chair ( kremmler@mtholyoke.edu ) during the summer or in September for individual placement or enroll in GRMST-223 .  All students contemplating spending all or part of their junior year in Germany should elect German in the first semester of their first year, since two continuous years of German in college are normally required for junior year programs in Germany.

GRMST-205  Decentering Europe: An Introduction to Critical European Studies  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   Europe embodies crossroads of multiple cultures, memories, migrations, and political demarcations. Taking a critical view of conventional paradigms of European nation states and "master" narratives, we study shifting European cultures and identities through multiple perspectives across time and space. What remains of the ancient and modern regimes? How have global movements, historical upheavals, and shifting boundaries within and adjacent to European borders, from early empires to contemporary global networks, affected the transformation of lives? Where is Europe heading today? Faculty from across the disciplines will join us to discuss Europe as a subject of global imagination and networks.

Remmler  GRMST-213  The Gender of Yiddish  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   Yiddish and questions of gender have a long history. The language was called "mame-loshn" (mother tongue); it was associated with home and family. Jewish women were the primary intended readers of Yiddish, beginning with religious literature for those who could not read Hebrew and developing into a modern, secular, often moralizing literature. Despite the strong connections between Yiddish and women, women writers have been marginalized and underestimated. This course will explore the gendered history of Yiddish, including through the lens of queer theory. We will also read English translations of literature by modern Yiddish women writers who are being rediscovered today through new translations and scholarly attention. Crosslisted as: JWST-213 , GNDST-210YD Applies to requirement(s): Humanities M. Cohen Notes: Taught in English.  GRMST-221  German Culture and Histories    Topics in German Studies provide students with an intensive study of major themes, issues, and paradigm shifts in German cultural studies.  GRMST-221CW  German Culture and Histories: 'Crafting Witches: Tracing the Historical Persecution of Racialized and Gendered Bodies Through Accusations of Witchcraft'  Spring. Credits: 4   This course focuses on the persecution of people accused of witchcraft, beginning with European pagan religions and the spread of Christianity; the "Burning Times" in early modern Europe, and 17th-century New England. We examine the connections between the persecution of those accused of witchcraft and the oppression of colonized subjects through global perspectives, looking at aspects of persecution that illuminate broad ideas about race and gender that arose concurrently with colonization and capitalism. Course materials include readings and film examining witch persecutions from contemporary feminist and postcolonial perspectives. Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive C. McNally Prereq: GRMST-201 . Notes: Taught in German.  GRMST-221DE  German Culture and Histories: 'Decolonial Approaches to German Culture'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   This course revisits German cultural production (textual and visual representation) through the lens of decolonial practices. We explore how modes of power, transnational exchange, cultural upheaval, and constructions of identity from the mid-18th century to the present are represented in German-speaking realms, both real and imaginary. What role does colonialism play in shaping early and present-day German national identities? How do particular historical movements, events, and narratives create multifaceted constructions of race, gender, and ethnicities? We will address these questions and others through case studies of pivotal moments in German history. Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive K. Remmler Advisory: Recommended German 201 or higher. Students who have not taken a German language course at Mount Holyoke are required to take the German Language Placement Exam. Notes: Taught in German.

GRMST-221GN  German Culture and Histories: 'The Graphic Novel in Germany: Histories and Identities in Words and Pictures'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   In this course we will read a selection of German-language graphic novels, including Nora Krug's 2018 Heimat: Ein deutsches Familienalbum , Birgit Weyhe's 2016 Madgermanes and Simon Schwartz's 1983 Drüben! . We focus on themes such as the representation of the Holocaust, reunification and migration and we examine the graphic novel as a unique literary genre that has garnered controversy in recent history. We will analyze the relationships between visual art and texts, as well as gain an understanding of how to read the graphic novel. Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive C. McNally Coreq: GRMST-221L. Advisory: GRMST-101 , GRMST-102 , and GRMST-201 or equivalent. Notes: Taught in German.  GRMST-221TH  German Culture and Histories: 'Black, Jewish and Muslim Cultures in Germany'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   This course examines historical, cultural, and political developments that continue to frame debates about the twentieth century, World War II, the former GDR, German unification, and contemporary German identities. As much as German culture is riddled with extreme examples of persecution and nationalism, the presence of those deemed non-German, such as Black Africans, African Americans, Jews, and Muslims, shape cultural expression and cultural exchange. Drawing from critical race theory, critical ethnic studies, and gender studies, we consider work by non-Germans as well as the representation of others in German canonical and popular cultural production. Thematic focus helps students develop accuracy, fluency, and complexity of expression. Reading, writing, and speaking in German are consistently integrated. Special emphasis is placed on text organization toward expanding students' language abilities, with a gradual movement from personal forms of expression to written and public discourse. Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive K. Remmler Advisory: GRMST-201 , or previous German Studies course, or placement. Notes: Taught in German.  GRMST-223  Topics in German Studies    Topics in German Studies provide students with an intensive study of major themes, issues, and paradigm shifts in German cultural studies.  GRMST-223AR  Topics in German Studies: The Art and Science of Revolution in German Cultures from 1789 to the Present'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   Revolutions are deeply embedded in cultural, economic, political, and environmental structure. Some are violent, some are peaceful; some evolve out of historical processes over long periods of time; and others emerge spontaneously without warning. Still others are material in nature, such as the industrial revolution or the end of the Berlin wall. The seminar explores the causes, forms, and impact of major revolutions in German cultures from the invention of the printing press to the most recent "Wende" that led to unification. Other revolutions include the French Revolution, the German Revolution of 1848, the founding of the Weimar Republic, and the student movement in 1968. Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive K. Remmler Advisory: Previous study of German, normally equivalent to 3 semesters of college German, or 3 or more years of high school German recommended. Notes: Taught in German.

Credits: 4   This course explores the use of gender in historical and contemporary fascist movements, examining the ways in which fascist movements construct images of "masculine" and "feminine" to shape ideology. We will look at the rhetoric of gender equity to enforce regression and oppression systems, and how these rhetorics are used as tools to enforce xenophobic and racist narratives against immigrants to the United States and Europe. This course will incorporate theoretical readings from political and social histories of 20th century Europe, gender and sexuality, as well as media sources like film, journalism and social media. Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive C. McNally Prereq: GRMST-221 . Notes: Taught in German.  GRMST-223MG  Topics in German Studies: 'Migration, Identity, and Place in German Cultures'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   In 2015, Germany opened its borders to over a million asylum-seekers. The ensuing debates about German national belonging, identity, and rights often overlook the contributions of immigrants, refugees, and displaced persons throughout Europe since the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). Indeed, migrants continue to shape European and German cultures today. Through close-readings and analyses of visual images, narratives, and films produced by or about the experiences of migrants and refugees from the 18th century to the present, this seminar traces how immigrant cultures shape contemporary German culture. Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive K. Remmler Advisory: Students with the equivalent of GRMST-201 or higher are welcome to enroll. Notes: Taught in German. The course may also be taken for 300-level credit with permission of instructor.  GRMST-231YN  Topics in German and European Studies In A Global Context" 'Yiddish Nation: Language as Homeland'  Fall. Credits: 4   For roughly 1000 years Ashkenazi Jewish culture has existed in exile. Since these stateless people were living in diaspora, without a sovereign territory, the Yiddish language itself became a symbolic homeland. This course will explore how some Yiddish-speaking Jews embraced their stateless existence not as a historic tragedy but as a revolutionary form of identity called diaspora nationalism. We will explore Yiddish cultural identity through literature, music, film, and politics. We will read works of history and cultural theory and seek points of intersection with other migrant, refugee, stateless, and diasporic cultures. Applies to requirement(s): Humanities M. Cohen Notes: All readings will be in English, prior knowledge of Yiddish is not required.  GRMST-295  Independent Study  Fall and Spring. Credits: 1 - 4    The department Instructor permission required.  GRMST-325  Advanced Seminar in Transnational and Transdisciplinary German Studies  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   What constitutes contemporary German culture within global perspectives? How might we apply critical race theory, critical social theory, ethnic studies, and queer studies, in order to interpret trajectories of German cultures, histories, and memories? Building on interdisciplinary close-readings of German-speaking cultural production ranging from novels to documentary film, students develop a research topic that spans the humanities, sciences, and/or social sciences. Students may build on previous scholarly work in German studies and other disciplines, community-based learning, internships, and/or learning abroad to consider major concepts, issues, or problems in an original manner. Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive K.

Credits: 4   This seminar explores the impact of different cultural forms of remembering the Holocaust within a global perspective. At the same time that the European Holocaust continues to be remembered, subsequent genocides and related mass violence around the globe are being remembered through multiple forms of memorialization, such as art, film, memorials, and narratives that mirror particular material and virtual forms of remembering the Holocaust. We explore how the interrelationship between Holocaust remembrance and other atrocities drives discussions about subsequent genocides, current antisemitism and racism, and forms of remembering violence.
