courses taught in English.Both courses are open to first-year students.Placement in German CoursesThe Department of German Studies will review the course selection of all entering students, taking into consideration school and AP records together with the results of theplacement exam.All students with prior knowledge of German who plan to elect German in either semester must complete this exam carefully.Final course placement will be based on the following considerations: the student’s specific training in German, the results of the student’s online placement exam, and scheduling possibilities.Students should take the online placement exam prior to registration, if possible.Students in Groups II–IV, as described below, are required to complete the online placement exam.Students may choose their courses according to the following guidelines, but all students are encouraged to consult with the chair of the department during the summer or upon arrival on campus.Email:kremmler@mtholyoke.eduGroup I: Students with no previous training in German, or with the equivalent of one year of study at the secondary school level, should electGRMST-101in the fall.GRMST-101andGRMST-102constitute a yearlong Elementary German course.Group II: Students who have studied German for more than one year but for fewer than four years, or who feel they need a comprehensive review of grammar, should electGRMST-201.Students entering in the spring who have studied German for one or two years may chooseGRMST-102in consultation with the chair.Group III: Students with three or four years of study in German should ordinarily electGRMST-221.Students with four or more years of German or extensive experience living in a German-speaking country or speaking

narratives, we study shifting European cultures and identities through multiple perspectives across time and space.What remains of the ancient and modern regimes?How have global movements, historical upheavals, and shifting boundaries within and adjacent to European borders, from early empires to contemporary global networks, affected the transformation of lives?Where is Europe heading

history.The language was called "mame-loshn" (mother tongue); it was associated with home and family.Jewish women were the primary intended readers of Yiddish, beginning with religious literature for those who could not read Hebrew and developing into a modern, secular, often moralizing literature.Despite the strong connections between Yiddish and women, women writers have been marginalized and underestimated.This course will explore the gendered history of Yiddish, including through the lens of queer theory.We will also read English translations of literature by modern Yiddish women writers who are being rediscovered today through new translations and scholarly attention.Crosslisted as:JWST-213,GNDST-210YDApplies to requirement(s): HumanitiesM.CohenNotes: Taught in English.GRMST-221

Histories: 'Crafting Witches: Tracing the Historical Persecution of Racialized and Gendered Bodies Through Accusations of Witchcraft'Spring.Credits: 4This course focuses on the persecution of people accused of witchcraft, beginning with European pagan religions and the spread of Christianity; the "Burning Times" in early modern Europe, and 17th-century New England.We examine the connections between the persecution of those accused of witchcraft and the oppression of colonized subjects through global perspectives, looking at aspects of persecution that illuminate broad ideas about race and gender that arose concurrently with colonization and capitalism.Course materials include readings and film examining witch persecutions from contemporary feminist and postcolonial perspectives.Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; LanguageOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveC.McNallyPrereq:GRMST-201.Notes: Taught in German.GRMST-221DE  German Culture and Histories: 'Decolonial Approaches to German Culture'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4This course revisits German cultural production (textual and visual representation) through the lens of decolonial practices.We explore how modes of power, transnational exchange, cultural upheaval, and constructions of identity from the mid-18th century to the present are represented in German-speaking realms, both real and imaginary.What role does colonialism play in shaping early and present-day German national identities?How do particular historical movements, events, and narratives create multifaceted constructions of race, gender, and ethnicities?We will address these questions and others through case studies of pivotal moments in German history.Applies to requirement(s): Humanities;

historical, cultural, and political developments that continue to frame debates about the twentieth century, World War II, the former GDR, German unification, and contemporary German identities.As much as German culture is riddled with extreme examples of persecution and nationalism, the presence of those deemed non-German, such as Black Africans, African Americans, Jews, and Muslims, shape cultural expression and cultural exchange.Drawing from critical race theory, critical ethnic studies, and gender studies, we consider work by non-Germans as well as the representation of others in German canonical and popular cultural production.Thematic focus helps students develop accuracy, fluency, and complexity of expression.Reading, writing, and speaking in German are consistently integrated.Special emphasis is placed on text organization toward expanding students' language abilities, with a gradual movement from personal forms of expression to written and public discourse.Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language; Multicultural PerspectivesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveK.RemmlerAdvisory:GRMST-201, or previous German Studies

cultural studies.GRMST-223AR  Topics in German Studies: The Art and Science of Revolution in German Cultures from 1789 to the Present'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4Revolutions are deeply embedded in cultural, economic, political, and environmental structure.Some are violent, some are peaceful; some evolve out of historical processes over long periods of time; and others emerge spontaneously without warning.Still others are material in nature, such as the industrial revolution or the end of the Berlin wall.The seminar explores the causes, forms, and impact of major revolutions in German cultures from the invention of the printing press to the most recent "Wende" that led to unification.Other revolutions include the French Revolution, the German Revolution of 1848, the founding of the Weimar Republic, and the student movement in 1968.Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; LanguageOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveK.RemmlerAdvisory:

gender in historical and contemporary fascist movements, examining the ways in which fascist movements construct images of "masculine" and "feminine" to shape ideology.We will look at the rhetoric of gender equity to enforce regression and oppression systems, and how these rhetorics are used as tools to enforce xenophobic and racist narratives against immigrants to the United States and Europe.This course will incorporate theoretical readings from political and social histories of 20th century Europe, gender and sexuality, as well as media sources like film, journalism and social media.Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; LanguageOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveC.McNallyPrereq:GRMST-221.Notes: Taught in German.GRMST-223MG  Topics in German Studies: 'Migration, Identity, and Place in German Cultures'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4In 2015, Germany opened its borders to over a million asylum-seekers.The ensuing debates about German national belonging, identity, and rights often overlook the contributions of immigrants, refugees, and displaced persons throughout Europe since the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648).Indeed, migrants continue to shape European and German cultures today.Through close-readings and analyses of visual images, narratives, and films produced by or about the experiences of migrants and refugees from the 18th century to the present, this seminar traces how immigrant cultures shape contemporary German culture.Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Language; Multicultural PerspectivesOther Attribute(s):

Jewish culture has existed in exile.Since these stateless people were living in diaspora, without a sovereign territory, the Yiddish language itself became a symbolic homeland.This course will explore how some Yiddish-speaking Jews embraced their stateless existence not as a historic tragedy but as a revolutionary form of identity called diaspora nationalism.We will explore Yiddish cultural identity through literature, music, film, and politics.We will read works of history and cultural theory and seek points of intersection with other migrant, refugee, stateless, and diasporic cultures.Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesM.CohenNotes: All readings will be in English, prior knowledge of Yiddish is not required.GRMST-295  Independent StudyFall and Spring.Credits: 1 - 4The

culture within global perspectives?How might we apply critical race theory, critical social theory, ethnic studies, and queer studies, in order to interpret trajectories of German cultures, histories, and memories?Building on interdisciplinary close-readings of German-speaking cultural production ranging from novels to documentary film, students develop a research topic that spans the humanities, sciences, and/or social sciences.Students may build on previous scholarly work in German studies and other disciplines, community-based learning, internships, and/or learning abroad to consider major

impact of different cultural forms of remembering the Holocaust within a global perspective.At the same time that the European Holocaust continues to be remembered, subsequent genocides and related mass violence around the globe are being remembered through multiple forms of memorialization, such as art, film, memorials, and narratives that mirror particular material and virtual forms of remembering the Holocaust.We explore how the interrelationship between Holocaust remembrance and other atrocities drives discussions about subsequent genocides, current antisemitism and racism, and forms of remembering violence.Crosslisted as:JWST-225HCApplies to requirement(s): HumanitiesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveK.RemmlerNotes: Taught in English.Students
