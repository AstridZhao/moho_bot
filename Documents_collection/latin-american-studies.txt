Spanish, Latina/o, Latin American Studies Faculty           Program Overview    As societies long defined by — and in opposition to — external powers, Latin America and the Caribbean have in modern times developed distinctive national and cultural identities celebrated on a world stage in art, music, and literature. The program studies the region in its enormous geographic diversity — from plantation to highland Americas, from Mexico to Argentina; and linguistic variety — four European, several Creole, and numerous indigenous languages. You may pursue course work in several thematic and geographic areas.

Credits: 4   A frame of mind typically refers to a disposition or perspective, but the term also suggests a shaping of perception and thought. Something has already "framed" our minds, delimiting the scope of the conceivable. But what? This course radically interrogates the frameworks that structure and constrain our minds. Students trace the history of commonplace understandings-in academia and the "real" world-of mental health, diversity, gender and sexuality, and economic development in order to upend and defamiliarize operative assumptions. Works by Wendy Brown, Michel Foucault, Coco Fusco, Byung-Chul Han, bell hooks, Paul Preciado, Boots Riley and others.
