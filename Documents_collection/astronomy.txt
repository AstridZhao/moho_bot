Search                      Academics    Find Your Program   Astronomy       Astronomy  Undergraduate   Modern astronomy is concerned with understanding the nature of the universe and the various structures—galaxies, stars, planets, atoms—within it. We are interested not only in describing these things, but in understanding how they are formed and how they change, and, ultimately, in reconstructing the history of the universe.      Astronomy Faculty    Astronomy Research                Program Overview    This understanding is always based upon the same set of theories and practices—physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, geology, mathematics, computer science—that we use to understand the earth and its immediate surroundings. Thus, you are strongly encouraged to base your study of the universe upon a firm grounding in one of these disciplines.  The Study of Astronomy most commonly takes the form of an interdisciplinary major in astronomy and physics; special majors combining work in geology, chemistry, computer science, and mathematics are also available. Alternatively, some students elect to major in any one of these fields, combined with a minor in astronomy.  All 100-level courses are taught by Mount Holyoke faculty and staff. Courses at the 200 level and above are staffed collectively by faculty in the Five College Department; many of them will be offered off-campus. You are urged to consult the department as early as possible to plan a program of study that takes advantage of the rich variety of course opportunities. Through advising, the exact program will be tailored to your particular strengths, interests, and plans.

The learning from such connections is important preparation not only for post-graduate education and careers, but also for active citizenship in today’s global world.  You can choose from on-campus opportunities with faculty, summer internships with members of the Five College Astronomy Department, and off-campus activities at NASA centers and with other astronomy research groups around the world. Our faculty will work with you to help sleuth out the best opportunities and help you apply for them in a timely fashion. Research undertaken in the summer for the senior year often leads to senior thesis, and further graduate study.            Courses and Requirements           Learning Goals  Major Requirements  Minor Requirements  Courses      Learning Goals        Learning Goals  Learning goals for introductory-level astronomy classes:  Understand fundamental concepts in astronomy such as gravity, the nature of light, the origin of the universe, and physical characteristics of matter.  Demonstrate skills for quantitative analyses, including the ability to form a hypothesis, graphically represent and interpret data, estimate error and understand sampling bias.  Critically evaluate representations of science in all types of media.  Learning goals for advanced astronomy classes:  Demonstrate proficiency in fundamental concepts in each of the major areas of astronomy: cosmology, planetary science, galaxies, stellar structure, and the universe.  Show a working knowledge of a broad array of physical phenomena that are based upon fundamental concepts.  Gain familiarity with instrumentation, computational methods and software resources utilized by professional astronomers.  Understand the variety of career paths and opportunities that are open to students who have majored in astronomy.  Exhibit a proficiency in the methods of scientific inquiry in laboratory and/or research projects.  Demonstrate use of critical thinking skills in well-organized, logical and scientifically sound oral and written scientific reports.        Major Requirements        Requirements for the Major  The astronomy major is designed to provide a good foundation in modern science with a focus on astronomy. Taken alone, it is suited for students who wish to apply scientific training in a broad general context. If coupled with additional course work in related fields, the astronomy major or minor provides the foundation to pursue a career as a professional astronomer or planetary scientist. Thus, advanced courses in geology, mathematics, physics, biology, and/or chemistry, as well as a facility in computer programming, are strongly encouraged.  Students should note that completion of this major will likely require them to travel to other institutions within the Five Colleges.  A minimum of 32 credits:  Course List  Code  Title  Credits  MATH-101 , MATH-102 , and PHYS-110 must be completed as prerequisites for the courses in this major. Select one of the following: 4 ASTR-100 Stars and Galaxies ASTR-102 Solar Systems ASTR-104 Planet Earth ASTR-105 The Sky PHYS-201 Electromagnetism 4 Two astronomy courses at the 200 level (8 credits) from the offerings of the Five College Astronomy department 8 One astronomy course at the 300 level (4 credits) from the offerings of the Five College Astronomy department 4 Two additional courses at the 300 level, in astronomy or a related field such as mathematics, physics, geology, biology, computer science, or the history or philosophy of science 8 One additional course at any level in astronomy or a related field such as mathematics, physics, geology, biology, computer science, or the history or philosophy of science 4 Total Credits 32 Additional Specifications  Students planning graduate study should generally regard this as a minimum program and include additional 300-level work. Advanced course work in physics and mathematics is especially encouraged for students wishing to pursue graduate studies in astronomy.        Minor Requirements        Requirements for the Minor  The goal of an astronomy minor is to provide a practical introduction to modern astronomy. If combined with a major in another science or mathematics-related field, such as geology, chemistry, or computer science, it can provide a versatile scientific background that prepares a student for future work as a scientist or technical specialist. Alternatively, the minor may be combined with a major in a nonscientific field, such as history, philosophy, or education, for students who wish to apply their astronomical backgrounds in a broader context that could include history of science, scientific writing or editing, or science education.
