mathematics that deals with the gathering, organizing, analyzing and drawing conclusions from data.Mathematics and Statistics FacultyProgram OverviewStatistics is used in most of the professions, in most sectors of the economy, and in a great many academic areas.Courses in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics are designed to:teach the language of the mathematical sciencesprovide a command of powerful mathematical toolsdevelop problem-solving skillsfoster the ability to ask questions and make independent discoveriesencourage the experience of mathematics as a distinctively rigorous way of knowing.In addition, especially through the statistics offering, the rich interplay between an applied context and mathematical models in working with numerical data is an area of particular emphasis.Each year some of our students enter graduate programs in statistics, or in allied fields (business, economics, education, or psychology).Many enter the job market and later pursue advanced degrees.Program InformationProgram TypeMajorMinorOutcomeBachelor of ArtsDepartmentDepartment of Mathematics and StatisticsCommunity VoicesSpotlight on Math and Statistics students and alumsGo to the

RequirementsMinor RequirementsCoursesLearning GoalsLearning GoalsWe welcome all students into the Statistics major, and we aim to create an inclusive, supportive environment for everyone.Statistics majors have the following learning goals:Communicate statistical concepts and their interpretation, with statistical colleagues and with a wider audienceDescribe key statistical methods and the reasoning behind themUse appropriate statistical and computational methods to explore data and draw conclusionsAsk questions about new methods and applications, learn new techniques, and make new discoveriesIncorporate “big picture” reasoning, including ethics, practicality, and creativity, into statistical practiceDevelop the independence to approach new problems, and the ability to collaborate effectively.Major RequirementsRequirements for the MajorA minimum of 36 credits:Course ListCodeTitleCreditsAs a prerequisite forMATH-203:MATH-101Calculus IMATH-102Calculus

AdviceBeginning the Study of StatisticsA natural way to begin if you have not studied statistics is with STAT-140, Introduction to the Ideas and Applications of Statistics.A 200-level course in statistics is a good choice if you have taken an advanced placement statistics course or have taken the equivalent of a 100-level statistics course.Advice to Students with Special InterestsActuarial scienceStudents interested in this area should plan to cover the material that is included in the first two actuarial exams as part of their undergraduate program.This material is included in Calculus I (MATH-101), Calculus II (MATH-102), Calculus III (MATH-203), Probability (MATH-342), and Mathematical Statistics (STAT-343), along with Macroeconomic Theory (ECON-211), Microeconomic Theory (ECON-212), and Economics of Corporate Finance (ECON-215).Students are also encouraged to obtain experience through an internship.Biostatistics, public health, or natural resourcesStudents interested in these areas should include substantial work in biology, chemistry, geology, and/or environmental studies in their programs.Economics or businessMany students with these interests design aspecial majorin mathematics and economics or aspecial majorin statistics and economics.EngineeringStudents interested in engineering often double-major in mathematics and physics and/or participate in one of the College’s five-year, dual-degree programs with Dartmouth’s Thayer School of Engineering, or California Institute of Technology, or the University of Massachusetts (see the Other Degree and Certificate Programs chapter).Graduate schoolStudents preparing for graduate school in statistics or mathematics often participate in an undergraduate research program in the summer after the junior year and continue with an honors thesis in the senior year.Students considering graduate work in statistics at the level of a Ph.D. are encouraged to include abstract algebra and especiallyMATH-301.Teaching certificationStudents interested in pursuing certification for middle school or secondary school should major in mathematics rather than statistics.However, there is increasing emphasis on statistics in secondary school, and any of the applied courses would provide good preparation.Course OfferingsSTAT-140  Introduction to the Ideas and Applications of StatisticsFall and Spring.Credits: 4This course provides an overview of statistical methods, their conceptual underpinnings, and their use in various settings taken from current news, as well as from the physical, biological, and social sciences.Topics will include exploring distributions and relationships, planning for data production, sampling distributions, basic ideas of inference (confidence intervals and hypothesis tests), inference for distributions, and inference for relationships, including chi-square methods for two-way tables and regression.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesT.Day, M. OzanneAdvisory: 2 years of high school algebraSTAT-242  Intermediate StatisticsFall and Spring.Credits: 4In this course, students will learn how to analyze data arising from a broad array of observational and experimental studies.Topics covered will include exploratory graphics, description techniques, the fitting and assessment of statistical models, hypothesis testing, and communication of results.Specific topics may include multiple regression, ANOVA, and non-linear regression.Statistical software will be used.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesI.Beaudry, C. HosmanPrereq:STAT-140or equivalent.STAT-244  Intermediate Topics in StatisticsSTAT-244MP  Intermediate Topics in Statistics: 'Survey Sampling'Fall.Credits: 4In this course, students will explore statistical techniques for designing and analyzing complex survey designs.Sample surveys are used to obtain data on demography, health, and development; to measure attitudes and beliefs; to estimate natural resources; to evaluate the impact of social programs; along with many other uses.The proper design and analysis of these surveys is crucial to their utility.We will cover topics including survey design, estimation, poststratification, imputation, and survey error.We will also apply these methods by frequently using real (and often messy) survey data through assignments and projects.The analysis of the data will be performed through R programming.Background should include estimation, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesI.BeaudryPrereq:STAT-140.Notes: No prior knowledge of the statistical software R is required.STAT-244NF  Intermediate Topics in Statistics: 'Infectious Disease Modeling'Spring.Credits: 4Infectious disease has plagued humanity since time immemorial.Statistical models serve a critical role in improving understanding of the progression and proliferation of infection in a population, as well as the impact of interventions in stopping the spread of disease.In this course, we will explore regression and compartmental model-based approaches, which will be motivated by some of the most impactful epidemics and pandemics in recent history, including HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19.R statistical software will be used.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesM.OzannePrereq:STAT-140.STAT-244NP  Intermediate Topics in Statistics: 'Nonparametric Statistics'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4The methods taught in traditional statistics courses are based on assumptions that are often not satisfied by real data sets.In this course we will learn about approaches that require fewer assumptions, known as nonparametric methods.After taking this course, students will be able to examine assumptions for different approaches to statistical inference, compare nonparametric statistical tests such as sign and Wilcoxon tests to their parametric equivalents, and implement non-parametric approaches using R. In addition, the course will incorporate computational techniques for statistical analysis, including simulation, permutation tests, and bootstrapping.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesThe departmentPrereq:STAT-140.Advisory: Students should have experience with the programming language R.STAT-295  Independent StudyFall and Spring.Credits: 1 - 4The departmentInstructor permission required.Advisory: The permission of the department is required for independent work to count toward the major or minor.STAT-331  Design of ExperimentsNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4How do you get informative research results?By doing the right experiment in the first place.We'll look at the techniques used to plan experiments that are both efficient and statistically sound, the analysis of the resulting data, and the conclusions we can draw from that analysis.Using a framework of optimal design, we'll examine the theory both of classical designs and of alternatives when those designs aren't appropriate.On the applied side, we'll use R to explore real-world experimental data from science, industry, and everyday life; and we'll discuss key principles for working with expert (and not-so-expert) collaborators to help them set up the experiments they need.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesThe departmentPrereq:STAT-242.STAT-340  Applied Regression MethodsFall and Spring.Credits: 4This course includes methods for choosing, fitting, evaluating, and comparing statistical models; introduces statistical inference; and analyzes data sets taken from research projects in the natural, physical, and social sciences.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesI.Beaudry, L.
