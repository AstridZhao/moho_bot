We are uniting students, faculty, staff, and community members to take the lead in reversing ecosystem degradation by advancing the science, practice, and social dimensions of restoration. Restoration Ecology Faculty and Staff    Restoration Ecology Research    Learn about the Campus Living Laboratory                Program Overview    The Mount Holyoke Restoration Ecology Program is a unique academic program that provides a foundational education in the diverse and interconnected disciplines composing ecological restoration. This program enriches the curriculum of students from a diversity of majors and provides formal training for students who wish to pursue a career in restoration ecology and related fields. Students participating in the program contribute to the science and practice of ecosystem restoration in two fundamental ways:  by helping to design real-world restoration projects with real-world consequences; and  by contributing to our understanding of ecosystem development and restoration practice by carrying out significant original research projects of their own design in topics that span the disciplines. The Restoration Ecology Program draws from majors across campus. REP students have studied the arts, languages, business, psychology, and environmental studies. What unites this diverse group is that every REP student shares a concern for environmental and social issues. REP provides students looking for meaningful ways to engage with the world an opportunity to pursue real-world solutions to real-world problems. Program Information  Program Type    Introductory    Department    The Restoration Ecology Program             Mount Holyoke Experiences  Why study Restoration Ecology at Mount Holyoke? The Restoration Ecology Program at Mount Holyoke College is the only program of its kind where students from diverse backgrounds and disciplines can use their liberal arts training to work with each other in groups on real restoration projects, developing tangible skills and individual expertise they can then apply to whatever they do next. The program instills critical thinking, problem solving, group work, and the ability to carry out projects from beginning to end as lifelong habits. We know of no other campus that makes use of its natural setting as a campus field station as Mount Holyoke does. We are uniquely positioned to take advantage of our rural location and our on-campus forest, lakes, and streams. Rather than driving long-distances to our field station, we walk outside our classes and are surrounded by it. “It’s very unique to have a field site that is literally a five minute walk from our classroom. It gives what we do an immediacy that you can’t really get from most college field stations that are located off campus.”  Erin Pierce ’15            Courses    ES 316 is the core course that introduces students to the science, practice, and social dimensions of restoration. Students in Mount Holyoke’s Restoration Ecology course study ecological principles, visit completed restoration projects, meet with professionals in the field, and contribute to real campus restoration projects. Students in previous iterations of the course identified and researched the site for the Project Stream wetland restoration project and have developed monitoring protocols for a suite of properties at the site.
