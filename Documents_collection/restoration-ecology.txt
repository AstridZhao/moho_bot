andby contributing to our understanding of ecosystem development and restoration practice by carrying out significant original research projects of their own design in topics that span the disciplines.The Restoration Ecology Program draws from majors across campus.REP students have studied the arts, languages, business, psychology, and environmental studies.What unites this diverse group is thatevery REP student shares a concern for environmental and social issues.REP provides students looking for meaningful ways to engage with the world an opportunity to pursue real-world solutions to real-world problems.Program InformationProgram TypeIntroductoryDepartmentThe Restoration Ecology ProgramMount Holyoke ExperiencesWhy study Restoration Ecology at Mount Holyoke?The Restoration Ecology Program at Mount Holyoke College is the only program of its kind where students from diverse backgrounds and disciplines can use their liberal arts training to work with each other in groups on real restoration projects, developing tangible skills and individual expertise they can then apply to whatever they do next.The program instills critical thinking, problem solving, group work, and the ability to carry out projects from beginning to end as lifelong habits.We know of no other campus that makes use of its natural setting as a campus field station as Mount Holyoke does.We are uniquely positioned to take advantage of our rural location and our on-campus forest, lakes, and streams.Rather than driving long-distances to our field station, we walk outside our classes and are surrounded by it.“It’s very unique to have a field site that is literally a five minute walk from our classroom.It gives what we do an immediacy that you can’t really get from most college field stations that are located off campus.”Erin Pierce ’15CoursesES 316 is the core course that introduces students to the science, practice, and social dimensions of restoration.Students in Mount Holyoke’s Restoration Ecology course study ecological principles, visit completed restoration projects, meet with professionals in the field, and contribute to real campus restoration projects.Students in previous iterations of the course identified and researched the site for the Project Stream wetland restoration project and have developed monitoring protocols for a suite of properties at the site.Learn more about the Project Stream siteContact usThe Restoration Ecology ProgramThe Mount Holyoke College Restoration Ecology Program offers a one-of-a-kind experience for undergraduates to engage with the growing field of restoration ecology.413-538-2607325 Clapp LaboratoryKate BallantineMarjorie Fisher Associate Professor of Environmental Studieskballant@mtholyoke.edu413-538-2607Restoration Ecology Faculty and StaffNext StepsApply to Mount HolyokeMount Holyoke seeks intellectually curious applicants who understand the value of a liberal arts education and are driven by a love of learning.As a women's college that is gender diverse, we welcome applications from female, trans and non-binary students.Start Your ApplicationFinancing your educationEveryone’s financial situation is unique, and we’re here to make sure cost does not get in the way of an exceptional education.Affording Mount HolyokeTuition and FeesExplore Related Undergraduate ProgramsEnvironmental StudiesSustainability Studies50 College StreetSouth Hadley, MA 01075 USA413-538-2000AcademicsAdmission & Financial AidStudent ExperienceWhy Mount HolyokeGivingDirectoryEventsAcademic CalendarAthleticsCareersCampus MapConsumer InformationConnect with UsInstagramFacebookLinkedInTwitterYoutubeNon-Discrimination PolicyMount Holyoke College is a women’s college that is gender diverse.The College is committed to providing equal access and opportunity in employment and education to all employees and students.In compliance with state and federal law, Mount Holyoke College does not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, color, genetic information, sex, national or ethnic origin, religion, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, sexual orientation, pregnancy, gender identity or expression, ancestry, veteran or military status, or any other legally protected status under federal, state or local law.Copyright © 2021 Trustees of Mount Holyoke CollegeDigital Privacy StatementTerms of UseLand Acknowledgement StatementAccessibility Barriers Form
