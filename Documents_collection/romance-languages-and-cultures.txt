Learn one, learn them all!      Romance Language Faculty           Program Overview    Through discovery and knowledge of other languages, literatures, cultures and social structures, all central elements of the liberal arts tradition, you will strengthen your ability to function in a cross-cultural and global context by coming to a deeper understanding of your own language and culture. The RL&C program is open to anyone who is eager to assure fluency in at least two Romance languages, as well as knowledge of the literatures and cultures they represent.  Besides taking courses at Mount Holyoke and in the Five College community, we encourage our majors to investigate the many study abroad and international summer internship programs, available to them in such culturally diverse cities as Mérida (Mexico), Montpellier (France), Florence (Italy) and Seville (Spain).  A major or minor in Romance Languages and Culture can lead to a variety of national and international careers including government, the culinary arts, academics, nongovernmental organizations, banking, fashion, and film.  Romance Languages and Cultures alums frequently go on to use their languages in conjunction with work in professional, service, and voluntary agencies of the world. A good percentage of our graduates go on to teach in elementary or secondary schools. Many have also decided to continue their studies at the graduate level, mostly by entering Master and Ph.D. programs in Romance Languages and Cultures.

In addition to acquiring advanced reading, speaking, listening and written proficiency in two romance languages, you may access your literary and cultural heritage through a variety of courses as well as activities and events.  Students often arrive at Mount Holyoke with an intermediate proficiency level in one of the romance languages (201 or higher) and decide to add a second romance language, starting in 101.  If you are considering Romance Languages and Cultures as a possible major or minor, you should talk to the chair as soon as possible. Planning is essential from your arrival at Mount Holyoke until graduation. Regular conversations between you, your major advisors, and the chair will be a key to your success.            Courses and Requirements           Learning Goals  Major Requirements  Minor Requirements  Courses      Learning Goals        Learning Goals  The main learning goals of the Romance Languages and Cultures program are to:  Assure (oral and written) fluency in at least two Romance languages, as well as knowledge of the literatures and cultures they represent.  View language/literature/culture in its interrelatedness.  Develop skills of communication and the critical tools to explore matters of aesthetics, cultural studies, history of ideas, and gender studies, among other areas of study.        Major Requirements        Requirements for the Major  The Romance languages and cultures major includes work in two of the following Romance languages: Catalan, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. The student will select two languages, one for primary and one for secondary emphasis. The student is also encouraged to attain intermediate-level competence in a third Romance language or Latin. Students interested in Catalan or Portuguese should consult the chair of the committee for appropriate Five College courses.  A minimum of 40 credits:  Course List  Code  Title  Credits  12 credits in Romance languages and cultures at the 200 or 300 level but always above FREN-203 , SPAN-201 , and ITAL-201 12 Additional 300-level Courses, divided as follows: 16 credits at the 300 level dedicated to the language and literature of primary emphasis 16 12 credits at the 300 level dedicated to the language and literature of secondary emphasis 12 Total Credits 40 Additional Specifications  FREN-203 and below and SPAN-201 / ITAL-201 and below do not count toward the 40-credit minimum.  Advanced courses in the major should be chosen to provide both a varied background and a means of focusing and unifying the major.  Qualified students are required to elect the Seminar in the Romance Languages ( ROMLG-375 ).  Normally the student is well advised first to broaden her acquaintance with the two principal cultures in which she is working, then to select a more specific aspect—a topic, theme, period, literary form, or genre, for example—around which to organize her choice of courses. Students desiring to develop an advanced knowledge of languages as their specific focus can consider advanced language courses in French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish that are available through the Five College Consortium.  No more than 4 credits of independent study (not including thesis credits) may be counted toward the 28 required credits at the 300 level. Independent study credits taken as part of an honors thesis do not count toward the requirements for the major.  Students should enhance their major by spending an academic year in a country where one of the languages of their major is spoken. Students who plan to take part in a study abroad program must consult both the chair of the Romance languages and culture committee and the chair of the target language. Normally, credits earned while studying abroad satisfy some of the requirements of the major.  Students are advised to complement their study of Romance languages and cultures with related courses in the fields of humanities and social sciences. These courses should broaden the cultural and linguistic expertise of the student.  Students who declare a Romance languages and cultures major automatically fulfill the College's "outside the major" requirement.        Minor Requirements        Requirements for the Minor  Students are expected to select a Romance language for primary emphasis and another one for secondary emphasis.
