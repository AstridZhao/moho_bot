its intersection with other forms of difference and power such as class, race, nation, sexuality, and species; and its intimate connection with myriad forms of knowledge and social practice, from scientific investigation to artistic creation and performance.As a gender studies major you will be introduced to the foundations of the field in courses on women and gender, feminist theory, and methodology.Drawing on courses offered across the Mount Holyoke curriculum and in the Five Colleges, you will then explore topics such as women’s literary and artistic production; gender in imperial and postcolonial contexts; feminist antiracism; women’s health; women and labor; violence against women; feminist science studies; queer studies; men and masculinity; transgender politics; U.S. women of color politics; women immigrants and refugees; transnational feminisms.A field-study seminar, taken in the junior or senior year; and a senior capstone course bring our majors together to think through connections among the diverse intellectual and creative approaches they have encountered as well as between scholarship and social action.Program InformationProgram TypeMajorMinorOutcomeBachelor of ArtsDepartmentDepartment of Gender StudiesCommunity VoicesSpotlight on Gender Studies students and alumsGo to the previous slide.Go to the next slide.Blending passions for both gender studies and art at Mount HolyokeSteph Maldonado ’23they/themBalancing a double major with being a member of the rowing team at Mount HolyokePiper LaPointe ’23they/themLeveraging a supportive community to access the impossibleMary Ann Villarreal ’94Explore more storiesOur coursesIn addition to introductory courses in gender studies and methods and practices of feminist scholarship, we offer 200- and 300-level courses on women and gender in the study of culture, history, philosophy, and science;

call for political change and social justice, particularly with regards to issues of race, gender, sexuality, class, and ability.Drawing from interdisciplinary and intersectional perspectives, we will examine the role of visual and performance art within public spaces in shaping and furthering social movements and protest.Some possible themes and issues include public memory, artistic citizenship, counterpublics, "material" and "immaterial" artistic forms, and the collective impact of art activism on the social imagination.Crosslisted as:ARTST-280SJApplies to requirement(s): Humanities;

asMetamorphoses(Ovid), this course will look at literature from the 20th and 21st centuries.Considering a wide range of genres -- novels, poetry, short stories, memoir, and young adult literature -- we will think about how writers talk about their bodies, their transitions, and their histories.Drawing upon fields such as history, medicine, and social science, this course will look at trans literature as both a product of these histories and as a powerful tool for critical liberation.Crosslisted as:ENGL-217TRApplies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural

questions of gender have a long history.The language was called "mame-loshn" (mother tongue); it was associated with home and family.Jewish women were the primary intended readers of Yiddish, beginning with religious literature for those who could not read Hebrew and developing into a modern, secular, often moralizing literature.Despite the strong connections between Yiddish and women, women writers have been marginalized and underestimated.This course will explore the gendered history of Yiddish, including through the lens of queer theory.We will also read English translations of literature by modern Yiddish women writers who are being rediscovered today through new translations and scholarly attention.Crosslisted as:JWST-213,GRMST-213Applies to requirement(s):

difference, and challenge the oppression of women.We will then address queer theory, an offshoot and expansion of feminist theory, and study how it is both embedded in, and redefines, the feminist paradigms.This redefinition occurs roughly at the same time (1980s/90s) when race emerges as one of feminism's prominent blind spots.The postcolonial critique of feminism is a fourth vector we will examine, as well as anti-racist and postcolonial intersections with queerness.We will also study trans-theory and its challenge to the queer paradigm.Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesC.Gundermann,

that controls not only gender, sex, health, food chains, science, politics, stock markets, and private/public distinctions, but has completely changed what it means to be human or animal.We will study these transformations, and how pharmocracy produces knowledge through experimentation on impoverished humans and animals.In the context of the post-9/11 legal emergency frameworks, pharmocracy is also the nearly impenetrable tangle between pharma, academia, public health, and the military biosecurity bureaucracies.Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesOther Attribute(s):

and art about man's anthropocentric relation to the nonhuman world.This course will read theories of the Anthropocene alongside artistic contemplations of the shifting, ethical relations among humans, animals, and other beings of the world.How are we to live, die, and reproduce ourselves in a time when we have egregiously affected the earth?How does the critique of anthropocentrism shift our

Eros'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4The erotic is a rich site of queer feminist thinking about the costs of the imposition of sexuality as an interpretive grid.The course begins with the study of sexuality as a knowledge system, with a focus on racial and colonial histories of sexuality, then moves on to considerations of the erotic.In both Lordean and Foucauldian genealogies, eros operates as a set of possibilities, or capacities -- for pleasure, joy, fulfilment, satisfaction -- that exceed "sexuality" and can inspire ways of rethinking nature, need, and relationality.Lynne Huffer, L.H.Stallings, Adrienne Marie Brown, Sharon Holland, and Ela Przybylo, among others, help us think capaciously about what the erotic can do.Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesA.WilleyPrereq: 8

during the 20th century left behind a legacy of political violence and collective trauma.These states themselves became sadistic death machines, where bodies became territories of punishment and discipline as well as of struggle, resistance, and difference.We will analyze how recent cultural production (film, novel, short stories, and theater) along with theoretical texts imagine and represent those "body struggles" through queer and female bodies, and how they replace the masculine icons of the left-wing militants and the state military terrorists.Crosslisted as:SPAN-350QHApplies

modern texts with various related secondary readings that will enable students to better understand the way that sexuality-both normative and nonnormative-was portrayed and interpreted in Renaissance literature.As we progress through the course, we will discuss what defines queer history and histories of sexuality, how the history of sexuality in the past informs the present, and, ultimately, the

Economies'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4At once viewed as a dysfunction of normative ideas about sexuality, the family, and the nation, Black sexualities are intimately linked to and regulated by political and socioeconomic discourses.Slavery studies scholars remind us of how it has proven foundational for modern notions of race and sex by making explicit links between labor and exploitation.Thus, this course moves through themes such as slavery historicity, intersections between Black feminisms and Black sexualities, sexual labor/work, pleasure, and the erotic, in order to consider the stakes of our current critical approaches to Black sexual economies and interrogate its silences and possibilities.Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural PerspectivesOther

call for political change and social justice, particularly with regards to issues of race, gender, sexuality, class, and ability.Drawing from interdisciplinary and intersectional perspectives, we will examine the role of visual and performance art within public spaces in shaping and furthering social movements and protest.Some possible themes and issues include public memory, artistic citizenship,
