social sciences.Learning GoalsMajor RequirementsMinor RequirementsCoursesLearning GoalsLearning GoalsThe department emphasizes approaches to learning that engage students more actively in the scientific, social/human, and global dimensions of environmental study.Each approach is a fundamental component of environmental literacy.Interdisciplinary Thinking:Students develop the ability to integrate knowledge using modes of inquiry that conceptually organize and link ideas, methods, and data from several fields.Critical Thinking:Students cultivate the capacity to listen and think analytically and critically by questioning assumptions, evaluating evidence, and articulating well-reasoned arguments.They also develop quantitative and qualitative methodological expertise.Depth of Knowledge:Students gain a solid understanding of how the natural world operates, how it has been impacted by human activities, and how it has influenced human actions and development through time.They recognize that solving environmental challenges requires knowledge of the underlying physical and biological processes involved as well as the complex ways these processes interact with cultural, historical, political, and economic forces.Intercultural Competence: Students appreciate the diverse cultures that make human society, and develop perspectives, skills, and knowledge to engage with values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of communities other than their own in environmental education, activism, development projects, and domestic and international research projects.Global Consciousness:Students recognize and understand global, national, regional, and local environmental concerns, perspectives, and experiences, including the impacts of economic, cultural, and political contexts on various communities and resources.SkillsIn order to meet the above goals, the Environmental Studies curriculum places a strong emphasis on habits of critical thinking and questioning across academic disciplines:Problem Identification, Assessment, and Solution:Students gain analytical skills in determining the scale and parameters of environmental problems.They develop an in-depth understanding of the scientific method, employing both quantitative and qualitative analyses to clarify and understand data.They become familiar with scientific, historical, and ethical analyses of environmental problems and are able to propose imaginative and creative solutions appropriate to specific issues, based on in-depth study of local to global factors.Communication and Information Literacy:Students recognize the breadth depth of environmental information, across a range of formats and fields.They strengthen writing and communication skills and develop a broad foundation of information literacy.They learn how to formulate and articulate questions, frame research projects, locate needed resources, evaluate information, and make critical judgments about the presentation of research.They are able to synthesize, present, and use this information in a way that helps answer a question, solve a problem, or educate self or others.Reflective Learning and Application of Knowledge:Students practice and develop their capacity for reflective learning in all courses, but especially in the capstone senior seminar.They develop the skills for peer feedback, self-reflection, and assessment of learning impacts.Experiential learning opportunities (e.g., community-based work, internships, and study abroad) allow students to increase their range of interactions with diverse peoples.They also develop leadership and decision-making skills including facility in working constructively with diverse perspectives, personalities, and groups.They develop pre-professional confidence in future options for environmental work in a range of government, education, business, and non-profit contexts.These core foundational approaches and skills are important in all facets of environmental studies and will serve graduates well in their post-college lives and careers.Major RequirementsRequirements for the MajorA minimum of 44 credits:Course ListCodeTitleCreditsIntroductory

economic system predicated on infinite growth achieve sustainability on a finite planet?This question will likely define the twenty-first century.This course aims to grapple with this paradox, examining the relationships and tensions between the globally dominant form of economy - capitalism - and global climate change.We will explore the interwoven rise of capitalism and emergence of fossil fuel energy, as well as the global expansion of capitalism and the connections between resources, economic growth, and political power.We will engage with various theoretical approaches to capitalism-environment relations, such as metabolic rift theory, the second contradiction of capitalism, and the production of nature thesis.These theories provide insight into recent forms of capitalism (i.e.neoliberalism) and the increasing degradation and commodification of the environment.We end by studying contemporary debates, examining institutions and policies seeking to manage climate change from with liberal-capitalist frameworks, the emergence of the "green economy", and the politics of climate denialism, concluding with alternatives economies and the climate justice movement.This course will provide students with theoretical knowledge and analytical skills for understanding economy-environment relationships.Applies to requirement(s): Social

in Flint, Michigan.Oil pipelines through sacred sites in North Dakota.These manifestations of environmental injustice and inequality are only the most recent incarnations of larger legacies.Environments are never simply natural or given: they are imbued with unequal entanglements of gender, race, class, and power.Environmental justice asks questions about the ways in which environments are produced, and the relations of risk, harm, benefit, access, privilege, domination, oppression, and liberation therein.In this course, we will study the theory and practice of environmental (in)justice in the United States.We will briefly explore histories of environmental injustice in the U.S. (from colonization and slavery, to industrialization and pollution); past and current struggles over the siting of production facilities, toxic waste, and pollution; and recent events around water (be they floods, toxicity, or protection): Hurricane Katrina, Flint, and Standing Rock.We will pay particular attention to questions of food and justice, examining gender, race, and class in agricultural labor, corporate power in agribusiness, food deserts, food access/health and white privilege, and gender in alternative community food movements.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesK.SurpriseRestrictions: Course limited to sophomores, juniors and seniorsPrereq: 4 credits

earth's surface, wetlands perform more ecosystem services per hectare than any other ecosystem type.Alarmingly, over half of the earth's wetlands have been lost to agriculture and development.With these wetlands were also lost the valuable ecosystem functions wetlands perform.This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to examine the biogeochemical, ecological, societal, and regulatory aspects of wetland ecosystems.Group discussion of primary scientific literature, as well as independent experimental design and the writing of a research proposal are core components.Field trips will sometimes keep us until 5:05 pm, and will provide an opportunity to explore these fascinating ecosystems in person.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesK.BallantinePrereq:ENVST-200or at least 8

have been at the forefront of environmental struggles.But how do Indigenous peoples characterize relationships with land/territories?How do Indigenous and other marginalized groups contest colonialism when engaging with their territories, and in politics?What alternative worlds do they imagine?This course will seek to answer these questions in connection to theories, concepts, and cases focused on the Americas/Abya-Yala.It will further center Indigenous and other marginalized ways of knowing, worldviews, and lifeways, when analyzing issues like pollution, conservation, or environmental conflicts.Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distrib.Rqmt; Multicultural PerspectivesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveS.CifuentesPrereq: 8 credits in the department or in

"human epoch") signifies that human activity has become the dominant physical force on the planet.Mainstream narratives envision three phases of the Anthropocene: industrial origins (1800 - 1950); global expansion and the nuclear age (1950 - 2000+); and an emergent third phase marked by massive shifts in land-use and biodiversity.This course undertakes a critical examination of the Anthropocene concept.We will analyze debates over geological demarcation, the term itself and the "anthropos" it embodies, and eco-modernist conceptions of a "good" Anthropocene.We aim to historically contextualize the socio-technical phases of the Anthropocene (industrial revolution, post-WWII global expansion, and contemporary globalization), situating them as processes emerging within a specific political-economic context (capitalism).Finally, we examine struggles over the socio-ecological entanglements shaping its future directions: urbanization, industrialized agriculture, genetic technology, and geoengineering/Earth System management.This course explores what it means to live in an era where a subset of one species can determine the conditions of possibility for life on the entire planet.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveK.SurpriseRestrictions: Course limited to sophomores, juniors and seniorsENVST-346  Global Inequality, Smart Earth Technology, and Environmental GovernanceSpring.Credits: 4This course is an interdisciplinary advanced seminar for students interested in learning about global environmental governance and inequality.We review the major theories about the intertwined challenges of poverty and environmental degradation, explore how legacies of colonialism persist, and examine how actors from nation states to Indigenous Peoples influence official state negotiations.Finally, we explore how advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and environmental sensor networks, and novel financial instruments, such as cryptocurrencies and nature-based video games, are changing conservation.As a curriculum-to-career course, there is strong emphasis on research, writing and speaking skills needed to advocate for environmental sustainability and social justice.Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural PerspectivesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive,

SecuritySpring.Credits: 4Food insecurity, warfare, disasters, energy, climate crises: how are environments enrolled in and entangled with questions of power, security, and geopolitical strategy?This course will explore relationships between population, resources, and scarcity, starting from the premise that scarcity is more often manufactured to maintain power than it is a "natural" condition.We examine the weaponization of environments in modern warfare, relationships between racism, pollution, (in)security and slow violence, the ways that climate change is being militarized and securitized and energy transitions are raising new questions of geopolitical power.We conclude with perspectives on rethinking security.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesK.SurpriseRestrictions: This
