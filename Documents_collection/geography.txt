to Present'Spring.Credits: 4This survey of radical geographic thought highlights liberatory geographic imaginaries from across the globe from the past two centuries.Radical geographers have developed powerful critiques of capitalism, empire, and modernization.They have also reimagined places capable of supporting deeply democratic social formations.This course will examine the political, economic, and cultural geographical concerns embedded in these critiques and counter-proposals.Among them, we will study 19th century Euro-Asian anarchism, Marx's late work on the "archaic commune," state resistance in Asia, post-colonial nation building in Africa, and feminist re-imaginings of sex, gender, and domesticity.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesP.CampanileGEOG-241RE  Topics in Geography: 'Geographies of Renewable Energy Transition'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4This course explores the variety of ways renewable energy transitions are imagined, planned, implemented, and contested throughout the world.Through empirical case studies, we examine how renewable energies offer new possibilities for restructuring societies but can also perpetuate social practices and worldviews that sustain relations of inequality.We draw on the geographic concepts of landscape, scaling, and spatial embeddedness to investigate why energy transition dynamics vary across space, and consider how cultural frameworks influence climate policies and individual energy choices.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesThe departmentGEOG-295  Independent StudyFall and Spring.Credits: 1

of urban and suburban settlement and commerce in the pre and post WW II U.S. Field trips to the greater Springfield area are used to allow students to develop firsthand understanding of interactions between urban and suburban areas and to recognize the major changes to the human landscape driven by suburbanization and urban abandonment.This class will examine the section of Springfield slated for the MGM Casino Development.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesT.MillettePrereq: Any 200-level Geography course.GEOG-312  Seminar in GeographyThese seminars present selected topics in geography that reflect contemporary problems, current geographical ideas, philosophical and methodological trends in geography, and/or the history and development of geographical thought.GEOG-312NC  Seminar: 'The Nature of Cities'Spring.Credits: 4This course critically examines the past, present, and future of thinking about the city from an ecological point of view.For a century, urban ecologists have thought about the city as an ecosystem: it follows the laws of all natural systems.While illuminating, this naturalistic idea has obscured certain historical, social, and political economic forces of urbanization.This is evident today in efforts to make cities more "resilient" and "sustainable."By intersecting urban ecology, urban political economy, and environmental history, this course reassesses the prospects of the ecological city in light of contemporary environmental crisis.Examples will be from across the globe.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesOther Attribute(s):

DevelopmentNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4Offers an interdisciplinary perspective on social, economic, and political features of contemporary development in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, regions referred to as the Third World or the South, and provides an introduction to theoretical origins and definitions of economic growth, development, and underdevelopment.It then addresses more specific aspects of development such as trends in population growth, migration, and urbanization; agrarian change; livelihood strategies and aspects of social welfare such as health, education, and shelter; poverty and the environment; and social justice.The latter part of the course draws extensively on selected case studies.Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural

in the Global SouthSpring.Credits: 4China is at the heart of development in the 21st century.In other words, it is impossible to understand the twenty-first century without understanding China.But is China a partner or a neocolonial exploiter in the Global South?How can we make sense of China's current record of infrastructure lending in Africa or the recent uptick in China-Africa trade?What is the geography of China's economic statecraft in Africa?To provide some answers, we will explore the on-the-ground realities of China's increasingly complex engagement with developing countries in aid, trade, investment, agribusiness, and technology transfer.We will examine China's emerging role by focusing on the spatial economic statecraft and geostrategic politics of Chinese capital flow.Applies

seminar focuses on climate change-induced human migration from both theoretical and applied perspectives.It examines the predicted scope of this population movement and considers international instruments that could shape responses to this growing category of migrants.A set of contemporary case studies from around the world animate our investigation into what it means to adapt to an altered environment and inform our questions about responsibility for climate change.Throughout the semester, students will grapple with the complex environmental, economic, cultural, and political intersections of migration and Earth's changing climate system.Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural PerspectivesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveThe

4Water is not simply a natural biophysical element that flows neutrally through landscapes.In this course, we will focus on the political, ecological, and historical dimensions of human water use in a changing climate.Throughout the course, we will examine ways in which water crises are produced and play out at various scales, ranging from the macro (global) to the micro (household) and human body.We will begin by strengthening our foundational understanding of water resources and laws that affect distribution, quality, use, and sustainability.Then, we'll dig deeper into the complexities that link water, people, and politics.In the last weeks of the course, we'll work on applying these ideas to dissect real-world issues such as the Flint and the Jackson water crisis.We'll also think about how to harness the newest and best ideas to sustainably and inclusively meet societal and ecological water needs now and in the future.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesOther
