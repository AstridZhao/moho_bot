Additional Specifications  Course substitutions for the above requirements will be allowed on a case-by-case basis where it makes sense for a student’s academic goals.  Up to 4 credits of PHYS-295P or PHYS-395P may be earned through summer research, following college guidelines for awarding PHYS-295P / PHYS-395P credit. Note that PHYS-295P and PHYS-395P credit must be arranged with the department before the summer research experience begins; typically, a single eight to ten-week summer research program will account for no more than 2 credits of PHYS-295P or PHYS-395P .  Normally, no more than 12 credits of PHYS-295 , PHYS-295P , PHYS-395 , or PHYS-395P will count towards the major.  Physics majors are also encouraged to take CHEM-150 .  MATH-203 (Calculus III – multivariate calculus) and MATH-211 (linear algebra), while not required, are recommended for those students planning to take advanced physics courses or to pursue graduate study. MATH-302 (complex analysis) and MATH-333 (differential equations) are also recommended for students planning to pursue graduate study in physics or engineering.  Students planning to pursue graduate study in physics are encouraged to take at least one graduate-level course in physics at UMass.

Courses must be at or above the 200 level in Physics       Courses        Course Advice  Getting Started in Physics  Entering students considering a major in physics are strongly urged to take PHYS-110 in the first year. While it is possible to complete the major by taking PHYS-110 and PHYS-201 as late as the second year, such a program is not recommended because this delay limits the student’s opportunities for advanced electives or honors work.  Introductory Courses and Distribution Requirements  PHYS-100 – PHYS-150 is a non-calculus introductory course sequence in physics, appropriate for students in the life sciences and for students with a general, nonprofessional interest in physics. This sequence satisfies the physics requirements of medical school.  PHYS-110 – PHYS-201 is a calculus-based introductory course sequence in physics, appropriate for students intending to major in a physical science. To major in physics, a student must complete PHYS-201 by the end of the sophomore year. A student with excellent preparation in physics may take a departmental placement exam to place out of one or both of these introductory courses. Any 200 or 300-level 4-credit physics course will then count for distribution in physics. PHYS-110 and PHYS-201 do not cover the full range of topics on the MCAT syllabus; the PHYS-100 and PHYS-150 sequence has a better coverage of these topics.

PHYS-328  From Lilliput to Brobdingnag: Bridging the Scales Between Science and Engineering  Spring. Credits: 4   The performance of many engineered devices is dependent on macroscopic factors (pressure, temperature, flow, conductivity).

More accurate multi-scale approaches for modeling macroscopic properties use basic atomistic level chemistry at key points in larger scale simulations. This course is an introduction to such approaches focusing on fuel cells as a concrete example.
