the minor requires a minimum of five.Among the required courses is an introductory course in either Latin American cultures or economies, one advanced literature course and a course focusing on less studied Latin American social groups.The program requires a command of Spanish or Portuguese at the advanced intermediate level and recommends at least an elementary knowledge of the other language.At Smith, the LAS major is anchored by a core set of four required courses in literature and history that provide the foundation for in-depth interdisciplinary study.Students must complete an additional six courses at the intermediate or advanced level, with two of these in the social sciences and at least one in the arts.A proficiency in Spanish at the advanced intermediate level is required and reading knowledge of Portuguese is recommended.The LAS Minor requires six courses.At Amherst College students develop their own major in LAS by writing a senior honor’s thesis in consultation with three advisors.At Hampshire, which does not have majors and minors, students develop a concentration in Latin America by writing their required senior honor’s thesis on a relevant topic and through an appropriate selection of inter-disciplinary courses.Latin American Studies at Mount HolyokeThe Graduate Program at UMassThe graduate certificate at UMass is intended to structure graduate study with a LAS focus, foster interdisciplinary scholarship and promote foreign language competence.To be eligible, students must be enrolled in a regular disciplinary or professional master’s or Ph.D. program.Candidates must complete a minimum of four graduate area study courses in three disciplines, demonstrate language proficiency at the advanced intermediate level, complete a thesis or dissertation on a Latin American theme and present their research results in the CLACLS Research Workshop.Graduate Certificate in Latin American, Caribbean, and Latino Studies at UMassFive College LibrariesThe total size of the Five College Latin American collection is in excess of 225,000 volumes, placing it among the 20 largest LAS collections nationwide, a true gem for undergraduates.The Pauline P. Collins Collection at UMass numbers 200,000+ volumes, over half of these in Spanish and Portuguese.The four colleges have not enumerated their Latin American acquisitions, but an analysis of their Latin American holdings (by LC call numbers) in Latin American history and literature yields a total of 25,812 volumes.Lorna Peterson PrizeThe Lorna M. Peterson Prize supports scholarly and creative work by undergraduate students taking part in Five College programs.The $500 prize is awarded annually based on nominations from Five College programs.Contact UsFaculty Committee:Javier Puente, Smith College, Five College LACLS Certificate Program ChairLeah C.
