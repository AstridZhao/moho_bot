Breadcrumb    Home    Academics                  Congratulations to the Winner of the CHS Art Contest!  During the Fall 2022 semester, students were invited to submit a photo or artwork to be displayed on the Culture, Health, and Science Program webpage. Please see below for information about the work which was selected for the prize, as well as the artist's statement. Skyler Sung (Amherst College) Littered mask (2020) 35 mm black & white film photograph During the Covid-19 pandemic, Skyler used photography to explore the “new normal” and how it changed the landscape around him in Honolulu. This image reflects his observation that although masks are vital in preventing the spread of the virus, they have created a new type of common litter that negatively impacts the health of the environment. He hopes that images like this bring attention to a more globally holistic approach to public health that considers all the different factors that contribute to it.                  About the CHS Program    Graduate schools recognize that tomorrow's health experts will need interdisciplinary training to link their understandings of history, culture, and behavior with clinical, biological, and epidemiologic models of health and disease. Students design a plan of study that approaches "health" holistically from the perspective of natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.  Completing a CHS certificate builds on the liberal arts approach to equip students with tools to think critically about health issues. For example, students may learn to:  Recognize historical patterns of disease distribution, treatment, and health disparities  Appreciate the value of integrating literature, philosophy, and the arts with studies in STEM fields (and vice versa)  Develop technical skills (such as research design, media literacy, gene editing, foreign languages, econometrics, doula training, or statistical analysis) to apply to health issues  Navigate healthcare systems and be an advocate for themselves and others  Apply contributions of multiple disciplines to the realm of public health, health promotion, cultural competence, disease eradication and global health  Students learn how behavior influences disease distribution, how biomedical categories change across time and culture, and how political and socioeconomic factors affect disease and treatment. CHS students learn to interpret and communicate their results to diverse audiences.  CHS is led by a Steering Committee of faculty members from all five colleges and a range of disciplines. CHS students work with their campus advisors to articulate objectives, select courses, and conduct independent projects or internships. Faculty and students alike are enriched by the cross-campus connections and interdisciplinary collaborations that the Culture, Health, and Science program fosters—locally and globally. Get on board!

On This Page                      The Five College Program in CHS firmly believes that the lived experiences and far-reaching consequences of structural anti-Black racism, white supremacy and racial inequalities are public health issues.  This is a longstanding crisis, which is being exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic and an ongoing climate emergency. The recent protests and the unfinished work demanding an end to systemic racism bring renewed urgency to our interdisciplinary approaches and inspire us to learn from vital traditions and develop new frames of reference. CHS supports students to listen to, learn from, and work with a wide range of communities and individuals with varied vantage points and backgrounds to advance common causes. In this way, we view ending racism and averting a climate disaster as intertwined core concerns that demand decisive, sustained, and collective action.                Faculty    Culture, Health, and Science Campus Advisors are faculty members in a variety of disciplines at each of the five campuses who work directly with students pursuing the CHS certificate to guide students through the CHS program, answer questions and help students plan for successfully completing all certificate requirements.  If you are in your final year at one of the campuses and plan on completing the CHS certificate before graduation, or are just starting and want to learn more about the program, CHS advisors can help you find your way.  Read about the advisors at your institution through the links provided, and contact the advisor of your choice to arrange an advising session.

Under the guidance of faculty program advisors on each campus, students choose a sequence of seven courses available across the five campuses and identify (in consultation with their advisor) an appropriate project or internship that will count toward the certificate. (Four semesters of a second language is also recommended, but not required.) Together with the visiting lectures and seminars sponsored by the Program, CHS provides a structure that is adaptable for students interested in pursuing health-related careers, as well as those curious to learn how different disciplines analyze common human experience.  Interested in pursuing the Culture, Health, and Science Certificate?  First, reach out to a campus advisor and fill out the Declaration of Interest Form . Then , take a look at the Student Timeline to stay on schedule with the certificate program requirements . We also recommend that you download the CHS Certificate Completion Form (below) to help you and your advisor keep track of what courses you need and what requirements you have fulfilled.     CHS Certificate Completion Form     Certificate Requirements  The seven required courses are to be distributed across the following five categories of inquiry:  Biocultural Approaches Interdisciplinary and/or comparative approaches that explore the interdependent influences on human health and disease  Mechanisms of Disease Transmission Mechanisms of disease growth and transmission within individuals and populations  Population Health and Disease Exploring the relationships among social, behavioral, economic and other aggregate population forces on human health and disease  Engaged and Humanistic Approaches Ethical, humanistic, artistic, and engaged approaches to human health and disease, including explorations of healthcare practice, policy, and activism.  Research Design and Analysis Concepts of evidence, data collection, research ethics, measurement and modes of analysis  Further Details:  No course can be used to satisfy more than one category.  No more than three courses can “double count” toward a student’s major.  Four semesters—or the equivalent—of a second language is recommended but not required. Such language training may be required for students seeking internships and summer research positions.  Independent Research Project  The Certificate requires the completion of an independent project such as an internship, thesis, Division III project, course project, independent study or other activity. You work with your campus CHS advisor to develop a project that satisfies both the Certificate requirements and your own interests. Not sure if you have an independent project that qualifies? Meet with your CHS Campus Advisor to find out.  Completion  When you complete the requirements for the CHS Certificate, return the completed Certificate Completion Form to your CHS campus advisor along with a copy of your transcript.   If you have any questions about the requirements or if you would like to pursue the certificate, contact your CHS Campus Advisor .             Courses    Note that if you don't see classes from all campuses currently listed, they will appear as the campuses release their course schedules for the semester. The five campuses release their schedules on different dates. Visit this page for specific dates.

You can download this document and search for regularly offered courses that have been approved to fullfil CHS certificate requirements. Search by campus, subject or number, as well as by each of the CHS requirement categories.  If you would like to fulfill a CHS requirement with a course that is not included on the ever-approved CHS course list, please contact your campus certificate advisor to request special permission and discuss your course options. You and your advisor can petition to add a course to the Ever Approved Course list with the Course Petition Form (below).  For a course to fulfill a CHS requirement, at least 30% of the content should be devoted to topics in human health. If you would like to suggest a course for the ever-approved course list, please contact us.     CHS Course Petition Form              Frequently Asked Questions      What is the benefit of the Culture, Health, and Science certificate?    The CHS certificate is a way to express a unifying thread in your undergraduate coursework. It enables students to demonstrate a multidisciplinary breadth that goes beyond a specific major. Pre-health students and those interested in health careers of all kinds use the certificate to express their ability to bridge a variety of different fields and develop a profile that is relevant to our multifaceted world.    What if I am a sophomore, junior, or senior? Will I still have time to complete the requirements for the certificate?    Often, the answer is "yes." If your studies have been in the culture/health/science genres, some of the classes on your transcript may already fulfill CHS requirements. It’s ideal to go into the CHS certificate with intention, but the requirements are not impossible and it’s likely any remaining courses can be completed in just 2–3 semesters.    How do I sign up to get the CHS certificate?    We strongly suggest you declare your interest as early as you can and get an advisor for the program. Fill out the Declaration of Interest Form as soon as possible and download the Certificate Completion Form to keep track as you complete the requirements. Again, please contact your campus faculty advisor early in your planning to get his/her advice.    How many courses may count for both my major and CHS requirements?    No more than three of the courses used to satisfy requirements in your major may also count toward CHS requirements. The remaining four of the seven courses must be from departments outside of your major.    How will this show up on my transcript?    We work with the offices of the registrars at each campus to make sure the certificate appears on transcripts of graduating CHS students as long as there is space (some schools only will include 2–3 credentials on the transcript; check your campus rules). We also send out physical certificates each July to that year's graduates.    How can I get into a CHS course on one of the other campuses in the Five College system?    CHS professors often hold spots in their classes for qualified Five College students. Check to make sure you have fulfilled the prerequisites for the class. It's a good idea to contact the professor early to let her/him know that you hope to use the course to satisfy a CHS requirement. Use the cross-registration procedures set up by your registrar to make sure that you are formally enrolled in the course.    Do I have to take courses on all five campuses to fulfill the requirements for the Certificate?    Not necessarily. It is recommended, but not required, for students to study beyond their home campuses. CHS is an inter-campus, interdisciplinary program; this is one of our greatest strengths. For that reason, we encourage students to take advantage of the wide variety of health-related courses available on the five campuses in the consortium.    What do I need to do to fulfill the requirement for an independent project?    The independent project requirement allows students to design and carry out a health-related project suited to their own particular interests. The project can take the form of a summer or January-term internship, a substantial research paper for a course, laboratory research, a Hampshire Division III project, an independent study or an honors thesis. It's a good idea to consult with your campus faculty advisor about your plans. A report explaining how your particular project contributed to your knowledge of human health may be required.    Do I need to take a foreign language for the certificate?    Foreign language study is not explicitly required in order to earn the certificate.  However, taking four semesters of a foreign language (or the equivalent) is recommended for the CHS certificate. Languages other than English are beneficial for those applying for international internships, graduate programs, and many jobs.    Once I’ve completed the requirements, how do I notify the CHS committee and get my certificate?    Review your certificate completion form and an unofficial copy of your transcript with your CHS advisor by the date listed on the checklist form. If your advisor agrees you have completed the requirements, the advisor will sign the form and send it to the CHS Steering Committee.  At the end of each semester, the CHS Steering Committee reviews all completed forms and makes a final determination as to whether the certificate will be awarded. The certificate award is noted on the student's transcript by the student's home campus registrar. A hard copy of the certificate is mailed to the address on the checklist form, normally in July.    Is there a grade requirement for courses that count toward the certificate?    There is no grade requirement, but you must pass a course to count it toward the certificate.    Can I count online courses toward the Certificate?    Online courses can be counted toward the certificate if the policy of your home institution allows you to count online courses toward your degree, and with the approval of your CHS campus advisor.    Can I count AP courses toward the Certificate?    No.    What about getting CHS credit for courses taken at other colleges and universities, including those outside the U.S.?    If you want to have a course from another college or university count toward the Certificate, consult with your campus faculty advisor. Your advisor will want to see a copy of the course description, syllabus and any work you completed for the course. The advisor may use his/her discretion, in consultation with the CHS Steering Committee, to decide whether the course will qualify for your CHS Certificate requirements.
