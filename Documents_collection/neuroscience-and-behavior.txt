Courses        Course Offerings    NEURO-100  Introduction to Neuroscience and Behavior  Fall and Spring. Credits: 4   This comprehensive survey course explores the brain and the biological basis of behavior. We will examine the anatomy of the nervous system and the unique properties of the cells that make up the brain. We will discuss the mechanisms by which individual brain cells communicate with each other, and how networks of cells underlie more complex processes such as perception, learning, memory, and behavior. Applies to requirement(s): Math  Sciences K. Colodner, M. Sabariego Restrictions: This course is limited to first-years and sophomores. Coreq: NEURO-100L.  NEURO-221  Research Techniques in Neuroscience  Spring. Credits: 4   This course will introduce students to modern techniques utilized in neuroscience research. Students will learn the underlying principles of an array of techniques spanning the fields of cellular/molecular, behavioral, and cognitive neuroscience. In lab, students will perform experiments that demonstrate these skills firsthand. Emphasis will be placed on the tools necessary to implement these studies, proper experimental design, and the critical interpretation of generated data. Applies to requirement(s): Math  Sciences K. Colodner Restrictions: This course is offered to neuroscience majors only.; Course limited to sophomores, juniors and seniors Prereq: NEURO-100 . Coreq: NEURO-221L.  NEURO-246  Cognitive Neuroscience  Fall. Credits: 4   Cognitive psychologists investigate the features and functions of the human mind through behavioral techniques; neuroscientists explore the physiology of the human brain. Cognitive Neuroscience lies at the intersection of these disciplines, and asks questions like: How are memories represented in the brain? Is our brain pre-prepared to learn language and if so, how? How does the average human brain still outperform most face recognition software? This course explores the cognitive and neural processes that support vision, attention, language, memory, and music. It introduces basic neuroanatomy, functional imaging techniques, and behavioral measures of cognition. Crosslisted as: PSYCH-246 Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences M. Breen Prereq: PSYCH-100 , NEURO-100 , or AP Psychology. Notes: This course counts in the cognitive or biol bases area of the psychology major.  NEURO-254  Psychopharmacology  Spring. Credits: 4   Psychopharmacology focuses on the impact that drugs (both illicit and prescription) have on the brain, neurocircuitry, and behavior. Students will explore the underlying neurotransmitter systems of the brain and discover how substances influence nervous system function including the experience of pain, sleep, emotional states, motivation, addiction, and mental health. The course will bridge concepts in chemistry, biology, psychology, and neuroscience by highlighting major drug classes and their underlying mechanisms of action. Additional discussions will focus on the economic, social, and political aspects of the drug market, as well as ethics and legalities of the drug industry.

From mental health and hunger to sexual motivation and aggression, our hormones dictate many of our basic choices and ultimately control how we interact with our world. This course will explore how hormones communicate with our brain to influence behaviors such as sexual attraction and reproduction, parental care, and social behavior. Special emphasis will be placed on the underlying biology and role of the nervous system in regulating hormone levels. Crosslisted as: PSYCH-256 Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences T.

Credits: 4   Neuroethics draws on the tools of philosophical analysis to investigate the role of neuroscience in our personal, social, and ethical lives. This class will look at the ethics of neuroscientific interventions such as cognitive enhancement, mind reading, and lie detection. We will examine how the neurosciences might inform philosophical discussions about human nature, personality, and ethics. In addition, we will look at the evidential role of neuroscientific evidence and how neuroscience technologies such as fMRI have influenced our thinking about the mind/ brain and person.

Credits: 4   This course is an interdisciplinary investigation of the nature of emotions and their influences on our thoughts and actions. While we will draw from a variety of disciplines, the nature and motivations of the inquiry are philosophical. We will consider: what are emotions? Are they bodily responses? Thoughts? Feelings? What roles do cultures play in shaping our emotions? What functions do emotions serve? We will examine evidence and arguments offered by philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, anthropology and evolutionary theory, and consider how these perspectives do or don't inform each other, as well as how they can help us understand the nature of emotions. Crosslisted as: PHIL-350SE Applies to requirement(s): Humanities Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive L. Sizer Prereq: 8 credits in Philosophy or Neuroscience and Behavior, or 4 credits in each.  NEURO-324  Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   This course will explore cellular and molecular mechanisms of nervous system development and function through lectures, laboratory exercises, and the critical analysis of primary literature. Topics include synapse formation and synaptic transmission, neuronal-glial interactions, the molecular basis of behavior, and applied genetic engineering techniques.
