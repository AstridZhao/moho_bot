BehaviorUndergraduateNeuroscience is the study of the nervous system, which can be approached at many levels—from molecules and cells to organisms and their behavior.Neuroscience and Behavior FacultyNeuroscience ResearchProgram OverviewThe interdisciplinary major in neuroscience and behavior is designed for students with integrative interests in biological and psychological science and a passion for scientific exploration.In addition to our core introductory and intermediate courses in neuroscience, course requirements will provide you with a solid background in both the current findings and modern techniques of biology, chemistry, and psychology, while course electives allow you to explore questions about the nervous system and behavior in greater depth.In keeping with the field as a whole, you may be able to conduct independent research as early as your sophomore year.Program InformationProgram TypeMajorOutcomeBachelor of ArtsDepartmentNeuroscience and Behavior
