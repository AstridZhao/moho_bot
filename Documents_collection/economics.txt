pressing problems—discrimination, environmental destruction, inequality, inflation, poverty, underdevelopment, unemployment—are economic in nature.Economics is concerned with the study of the causes and the possible solutions to these and other economic and social problems.Economics FacultyEconomics ResearchProgram OverviewAs an economics student, you will acquire the necessary analytical tools to understand contemporary economic issues and to take reasoned positions in debates about economic and social policy.You will be in a position to apply these tools in a multitude of areas in a future career and be well prepared to continue study of economics at the graduate level.Macroeconomics deals with the economy as a whole, with the forces behind economic growth, the problems occurring in the growth process (such as business cycles, inflation, and unemployment), and government policies to address these problems.Microeconomics focuses on the efficient allocation of resources among alternative uses and addresses such questions as how individuals, firms, and societies decide what to produce, how to produce, and how to distribute the output.Economists study these important issues by combining theoretical models and data analysis.The great human interest of the subject, together with the rigor of its analysis make the study of economics continuously thought-provoking and relevant.Program InformationProgram TypeMajorMinorOutcomeBachelor of ArtsDepartmentDepartment of EconomicsCommunity VoicesSpotlight on Economics students and alumsGo to the previous slide.Go to the

analytical tools to understand contemporary economic issues and to take reasoned positions in debates about economic and social policy.More specifically, achievement of this overarching learning goal entails that the graduating senior:Has mastered the core body of economic theory, which necessitates solid quantitative, problem solving and critical thinking skills.Understands how different theoretical approaches in economics lead to different explanations and policy conclusions.Understands how economic inquiry differs from other approaches to social inquiry.Has conducted research on questions of economic theory and policy usually combining theoretical models and data analysis.Students begin with the core courses (Macroeconomic Theory, Microeconomic Theory, and Econometrics), the objective of which is to intensively examine the theoretical tools used in professional economic research (see below for specific course goals).Seminars at the 200- and 300-level then allow students to choose from a wide array of classes that apply economic theory to particular areas, drawing and building on the concepts and analytical tools developed in these introductory coursesMacroeconomic Theory (ECON-211)Students will be able to explain the concepts of opportunity cost, trade-offs, and the benefits of exchange.Students will demonstrate knowledge of the laws of supply and demand and equilibrium and to analyze responses of markets to external events.Students will understand the concepts of gross domestic product, inflation and unemployment.Students will demonstrate knowledge of the circular flow model and use the concepts of aggregate demand and aggregate supply to analyze the response of the economy to disturbances.Students will understand and describe the determinants of the demand for money, the supply of money and interest rates and the role of financial institutions in the economy.Students will learn to define fiscal and monetary policies and how these affect the economy.Students will be able to identify the causes of prosperity, growth, and economic change over time and to explain the mechanisms through which these causes operate in the economy.Microeconomic Theory (ECON-212)Students will be able to explain the concepts of opportunity cost, trade-offs, and the benefits of exchange.Students will demonstrate knowledge of the laws of supply and demand and equilibrium and to analyze responses of markets to external events.Students will learn to apply supply and demand analysis to examine the impact of government regulation.Students will be able to explain and calculate price elasticity and will demonstrate an understanding of producer choice, including cost and break-even analysis.Students will learn to compare common market structures.Students will be able to apply microeconomic principles and models to define and address market failures and to describe issues such as wage inequality or other policy matters.Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-220)Students will be able to explain core concepts and techniques in econometrics and will understand the assumptions upon which econometric models are based and their implications.Students will be able to estimate and interpret linear regression models and distinguish between economic and statistical importance.Students will be introduced to statistical software used to estimate regression models and analyze data, and will demonstrate the ability to understand and assess results.Students will learn to interpret and critically evaluate applied work and econometric findings in order to be able to critique reported regression results in applied academic papers and interpret the results for someone who is not trained as an economist.Major RequirementsRequirements for the MajorA minimum

intermediate level courses.There are a number of 200-level courses that can be taken as a first course in economics, though these courses are not open to first-semester students without previous economics experience.The objective of the core courses is to examine intensively the theoretical tools used in professional economic research.One or more of the core courses is required for each 300-level course in the department.At the intermediate level, a student can choose from a wide array of courses that apply economic theory to particular areas, drawing and building on the concepts and analytical tools developed in the introductory courses.Most 300-level courses are applied courses as well, but the level of analytical sophistication is higher, and students are expected to write substantial analytical research papers.The applied areas offered in the department cover a wide range of subjects, including corporate governance, economic development, economic history, economics of corporate finance, environmental economics, health economics, industrial organization, international economics, macroeconomic advanced game theory, Marxian economic theory, and public finance.Students considering developing a special major in mathematics and economics or statistics and economics should consult theSpecial Majorchapter.Minor RequirementsRequirements for the MinorA minimum of 16

HartleyRestrictions: Course limited to sophomores, juniors and seniorsPrereq:ECON-110.ECON-219  Environmental EconomicsSpring.Credits: 4In this class, we will use the lens of economic analysis to examine how environmental problems arise and what can be done to resolve them.This will include an assessment of relevant environmental policies (e.g., carbon tax & cap-and-trade programs), how these policies function, and what impacts they have on people and the economy.Topics include market failures and externalities, pollution, climate change, management of renewable and nonrenewable resources, sustainability, biodiversity, and others.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesT.GillilandPrereq:ECON-110.ECON-220  Introduction to EconometricsFall and Spring.Credits: 4A study of statistical methods applied to economic and social data.Measures of central tendency and dispersion, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, simple correlation, and simple and multiple regression analysis.Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution RequirementS.Adelman, T. GillilandPrereq:ECON-110andMATH-101.ECON-228  Political EconomySpring.Credits: 4This course introduces students to the modal interdisciplinary approach of political economy, an approach that de-centers economics from a narrow focus on optimization and hype-rationality to a broader vision of how the behavior of homo sapiens acting as economic agents is shaped by social and psychological processes.Thus, the determinants of economic outcomes are similarly impacted by emotional and social context.This course will offer a critical exploration of how the works of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Amartya Sen, and others have informed approaches to the study of political economy.Topics to be explored include: how socially constructed concepts of gender (as opposed to biological sex) and race/ethnicity impact value distribution; power dynamics in the workplace and larger society; and social investment thereby shaping the cultural architecture and economic processes that contribute to inequality.One of the objectives of this course is to specifically address the role of capital accumulation and mercantilist tendencies in modern capitalist economies in the diminution of productive self-employment, family businesses, and other alternatives to large-scale enterprises, leading to distorted forms of development resulting in catastrophic effects to the global ecology.Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural PerspectivesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-IntensiveS.GabrielRestrictions: Course limited to sophomores, juniors and seniorsECON-241  Critical Development StudiesFall.Credits: 4Critical development studies explore the economic, political, cultural, and environmental conditions underpinning global economic systems (i.e.large-scale industrial, merchanting, and financial systems).Critical development studies seek to understand the dynamics of such systems and to develop methodologies for reducing marginalization and inequalities, to give the voiceless a voice in shaping public policies.These political economic studies often draw links between imperialism, colonization, slavery, and unequal trading relationships.In this course, we will seek to understand and evaluate proposals for advancing a better development path for the marginalized along constructed class, gender, and racial lines.Applies

Advanced Topics in Economics: 'Analysis of Empire of Cotton'Fall.Credits: 4This course focuses on analyzing the "Empire of Cotton," as it was labeled by Pulitzer Prize nominee Sven Beckert.This course explores the nexus between war capitalism as epitomized by British subjugation of peoples around the world, notably in India (the jewel in the crown) and China; the massive seizure of advanced textile manufacturing machines and raw materials (notably raw cotton), and the industrial revolution.The course also examines the history of globalization in this period of knowledge transfer, mass human trafficking, and slave economies of the USA, Caribbean, and South America.A basic hypothesis explored in the course will be whether this Empire of Cotton played a pivotal role in creating income and wealth inequalities between the so-called North and the marginalized South, inequalities that persist in the present.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive,
