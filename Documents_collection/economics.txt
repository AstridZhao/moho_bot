Search                      Academics    Find Your Program   Economics       Economics  Undergraduate   Many of the world’s most pressing problems—discrimination, environmental destruction, inequality, inflation, poverty, underdevelopment, unemployment—are economic in nature. Economics is concerned with the study of the causes and the possible solutions to these and other economic and social problems. Economics Faculty    Economics Research           Program Overview    As an economics student, you will acquire the necessary analytical tools to understand contemporary economic issues and to take reasoned positions in debates about economic and social policy. You will be in a position to apply these tools in a multitude of areas in a future career and be well prepared to continue study of economics at the graduate level. Macroeconomics deals with the economy as a whole, with the forces behind economic growth, the problems occurring in the growth process (such as business cycles, inflation, and unemployment), and government policies to address these problems. Microeconomics focuses on the efficient allocation of resources among alternative uses and addresses such questions as how individuals, firms, and societies decide what to produce, how to produce, and how to distribute the output. Economists study these important issues by combining theoretical models and data analysis. The great human interest of the subject, together with the rigor of its analysis make the study of economics continuously thought-provoking and relevant.

Learning Goals  Major Requirements  Minor Requirements  Courses      Learning Goals        Learning Goals  An economics major who graduates from Mount Holyoke College will have mastered the necessary analytical tools to understand contemporary economic issues and to take reasoned positions in debates about economic and social policy. More specifically, achievement of this overarching learning goal entails that the graduating senior:  Has mastered the core body of economic theory, which necessitates solid quantitative, problem solving and critical thinking skills. Understands how different theoretical approaches in economics lead to different explanations and policy conclusions. Understands how economic inquiry differs from other approaches to social inquiry. Has conducted research on questions of economic theory and policy usually combining theoretical models and data analysis. Students begin with the core courses (Macroeconomic Theory, Microeconomic Theory, and Econometrics), the objective of which is to intensively examine the theoretical tools used in professional economic research (see below for specific course goals). Seminars at the 200- and 300-level then allow students to choose from a wide array of classes that apply economic theory to particular areas, drawing and building on the concepts and analytical tools developed in these introductory courses  Macroeconomic Theory ( ECON-211 )  Students will be able to explain the concepts of opportunity cost, trade-offs, and the benefits of exchange. Students will demonstrate knowledge of the laws of supply and demand and equilibrium and to analyze responses of markets to external events. Students will understand the concepts of gross domestic product, inflation and unemployment. Students will demonstrate knowledge of the circular flow model and use the concepts of aggregate demand and aggregate supply to analyze the response of the economy to disturbances. Students will understand and describe the determinants of the demand for money, the supply of money and interest rates and the role of financial institutions in the economy. Students will learn to define fiscal and monetary policies and how these affect the economy. Students will be able to identify the causes of prosperity, growth, and economic change over time and to explain the mechanisms through which these causes operate in the economy. Microeconomic Theory ( ECON-212 )  Students will be able to explain the concepts of opportunity cost, trade-offs, and the benefits of exchange. Students will demonstrate knowledge of the laws of supply and demand and equilibrium and to analyze responses of markets to external events. Students will learn to apply supply and demand analysis to examine the impact of government regulation. Students will be able to explain and calculate price elasticity and will demonstrate an understanding of producer choice, including cost and break-even analysis. Students will learn to compare common market structures. Students will be able to apply microeconomic principles and models to define and address market failures and to describe issues such as wage inequality or other policy matters. Introduction to Econometrics ( ECON-220 )  Students will be able to explain core concepts and techniques in econometrics and will understand the assumptions upon which econometric models are based and their implications. Students will be able to estimate and interpret linear regression models and distinguish between economic and statistical importance. Students will be introduced to statistical software used to estimate regression models and analyze data, and will demonstrate the ability to understand and assess results. Students will learn to interpret and critically evaluate applied work and econometric findings in order to be able to critique reported regression results in applied academic papers and interpret the results for someone who is not trained as an economist.

Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution Requirement S. Adelman, T. Gilliland Prereq: ECON-110 and MATH-101 . ECON-228  Political Economy  Spring. Credits: 4   This course introduces students to the modal interdisciplinary approach of political economy, an approach that de-centers economics from a narrow focus on optimization and hype-rationality to a broader vision of how the behavior of homo sapiens acting as economic agents is shaped by social and psychological processes. Thus, the determinants of economic outcomes are similarly impacted by emotional and social context. This course will offer a critical exploration of how the works of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Amartya Sen, and others have informed approaches to the study of political economy. Topics to be explored include: how socially constructed concepts of gender (as opposed to biological sex) and race/ethnicity impact value distribution; power dynamics in the workplace and larger society; and social investment thereby shaping the cultural architecture and economic processes that contribute to inequality. One of the objectives of this course is to specifically address the role of capital accumulation and mercantilist tendencies in modern capitalist economies in the diminution of productive self-employment, family businesses, and other alternatives to large-scale enterprises, leading to distorted forms of development resulting in catastrophic effects to the global ecology. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive S. Gabriel Restrictions: Course limited to sophomores, juniors and seniors  ECON-241  Critical Development Studies  Fall. Credits: 4   Critical development studies explore the economic, political, cultural, and environmental conditions underpinning global economic systems (i.e. large-scale industrial, merchanting, and financial systems). Critical development studies seek to understand the dynamics of such systems and to develop methodologies for reducing marginalization and inequalities, to give the voiceless a voice in shaping public policies. These political economic studies often draw links between imperialism, colonization, slavery, and unequal trading relationships. In this course, we will seek to understand and evaluate proposals for advancing a better development path for the marginalized along constructed class, gender, and racial lines.

Credits: 4   Questions like "How can a country achieve sustainable development?" or "What is the cause of poverty?" can be daunting and overwhelming to examine, with no immediate answers. Why have some countries remained poor with few successes? Are there interventions in these countries that have increased well-being in specific areas? In this seminar, we focus on this last question and explore research studies in Africa that ask smaller questions with specific answers. We will critically examine what has worked and learn from what has not in addressing outcomes in micro-economic topics related to education and entrepreneurship, among others. We will also consider how these studies can be generalized and extended. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive A.

Credits: 4   This course focuses on analyzing the "Empire of Cotton," as it was labeled by Pulitzer Prize nominee Sven Beckert. This course explores the nexus between war capitalism as epitomized by British subjugation of peoples around the world, notably in India (the jewel in the crown) and China; the massive seizure of advanced textile manufacturing machines and raw materials (notably raw cotton), and the industrial revolution. The course also examines the history of globalization in this period of knowledge transfer, mass human trafficking, and slave economies of the USA, Caribbean, and South America. A basic hypothesis explored in the course will be whether this Empire of Cotton played a pivotal role in creating income and wealth inequalities between the so-called North and the marginalized South, inequalities that persist in the present.

Independent Research  We strongly encourage students to pursue independent research under ECON-295 or ECON-395 . These courses, which are offered for a variable number of credits, provide opportunities for many different kinds of independent projects. Both ECON-295 and ECON-395 typically encompass a small research project, possibly in conjunction with faculty research. A student works individually on her thesis over a two-semester period, first by registering for ECON-395 in the falland then by finishing with ECON-395 in the spring (4 credits in each semester) for a total of 8 credits. Each thesis is supervised by a committee of two faculty members, one of whom serves as the primary advisor. A one-semester ECON-395 project may not be counted toward the courses required for the major or minor at the 300 level. For a two semester ECON-395 project culminating in a thesis, the second semester may count toward this requirement. ECON-295  Independent Study  Fall and Spring.
