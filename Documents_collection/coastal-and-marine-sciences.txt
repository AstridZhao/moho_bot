Faculty Leadership Development ProgramsWomen's Studies Research CenterCoastal & Marine SciencesOffering an interdisciplinary marine-related curriculum to undergraduate students enrolled in the five campuses.BreadcrumbHomeAcademicsThe Five College Coastal and Marine Sciences Program offers an interdisciplinary marine-related curriculum to undergraduate students enrolled in a Five College campus.The Coastal and Marine Sciences Certificate is available to students at all five campuses.Through active affiliations with some of the nation's premier centers for marine study (field trips, internships, and study-away programs), students engage in hands-on research to complement course work.Many students who participate in the program go on to advanced study or professional work in various areas of marine science.Five College faculty from both natural and social sciences teach courses in the program.The disciplines represented include animal behavior, biology, botany, chemistry, ecology, engineering, geology, natural resource management, and zoology in the natural sciences, and government, public policy and economics in the social sciences.On This PageCoastal & Marine Sciences CertificateThe Five College Coastal and Marine Sciences Certificate enables students from the five campuses to select from a wide variety of marine-science-related courses, including coastal and marine ecology/geology, resource management and public policy, oceanography and coastal engineering to create a cohesive concentration.The Five College Coastal and Marine Sciences Certificate is now available to students on all five campuses.The FCCMS certificate work includes three components:1) Course work (6 courses)2) Field and lab work (80 hour minimum)3) Independent research project/posterUnder the guidance of faculty advisors on each campus, students choose a progressive series of courses available within the five campuses and in approved academic off-campus programs (Sea Education Association, School for Field Studies, Williams-Mystic, Duke University Marine Lab, Shoals Marine Lab, and others).Students are required to gain proficiency in field/lab work through intensive field courses or internships.Finally, students participate in a “capstone” independent, marine-related research project that will count toward the certificate.Students interested in earning the certificate should begin by setting up an introductory meeting with the Program Coordinator (see People).Once students have begun the introductory course of study, they will be appointed a faculty advisor affiliated with Five College Coastal and Marine Sciences who will assist with course selection, research projects and field/lab requirements to ensure a strong concentration in marine sciences.Related LinksCertificate RequirementsField/Lab Work Log DownloadResearch Project Proposal Form DownloadCertificate Application DownloadIndependent Research Project GuidancePoster HelpRelated PagesOpportunities & ResourcesPeopleThe program office is located at Five Colleges, Inc., 97 Spring Street in Amherst.Students interested in learning more about the Five College Coastal and Marine Sciences Certificate or internship program should schedule a meeting with Program Coordinator Cindy Bright, available by appointment on your home campus (see contact info below).Students affiliated with the program receive information on campus lectures, films and events as well as information on internships and research opportunities in the field.The FCCMS Program is guided by a steering committee with members from each of the five campuses.Steering committee members also serve as faculty advisors to certificate students.Steering Committee & Faculty AdvisorsAmherst CollegeAlexandra
