water availability and population growth; waste treatment and disposal; sustainable land use; and the interaction of the ocean and the atmosphere.Program InformationProgram TypeMajorMinorOutcomeBachelor of ArtsDepartmentDepartment of Geology and GeographyCommunity VoicesSpotlight on Geology students and alumsGo to the previous slide.Go to the next slide.A series of fortunate events!Marsha Allen FP’10, Graduate student, University of Massachusetts AmherstFieldwork for all!Katharine Hinkle ’02 Science teacher, Innovation Academy Charter School, MassachusettsFinding my unique path from geology to data scienceAlexandra Horne ’12 Data Scientist, ADM Associates, Inc.Explore more storiesOur coursesWe offer courses that cover a wide range of topics, among them oceanography, environmental geology, geomorphology, petrology, structural geology, plate tectonics, climate change, geological resources, field geology, groundwater, evolution, and the history of the earth.Majors may also consider taking other geology courses in the Five Colleges.Selecting courses in your first yearYou are encouraged to enroll in any of the following courses:Geology 103s - OceanographyGeology 107f - Environmental GeologyGeology 109f - History of LifeGeology 123fs - Methods in Earth ScienceGeology 201f - Rocks and MineralsYou may also consider enrolling in:Chemistry 150fs - General ChemistryMathematics 101fs - Calculus IPhysics 110fs - Force, Motion, and EnergyStatistics 140fs - Introduction to the Ideas and Applications of StatisticsCourses and RequirementsLearning GoalsMajor RequirementsMinor RequirementsCoursesLearning GoalsLearning GoalsStudents majoring or minoring in geology learn about the dynamic processes and history that shaped our planet and provide us with the resources and natural environments on which we rely.This is a fascinating field of study that also prepares one for outstanding employment opportunities.Our courses are designed to achieve the following learning goals:Develop observational and quantitative skills appropriate for field, laboratory, analytical, and modeling methods of geoscience inquiry.Develop sophisticated and nuanced reasoning skills to evaluate multiple working hypotheses, integrate earth science data gathered at different spatial and temporal scales, and critically assess data, ideas, and methods from the published literature.Become an effective communicator, able to ask interesting questions, collaborate with peers, and engage thoughtfully and respectfully in discussion;

Knight, we will examine how paleoartists have uncovered key information about prehistoric life well in advance of its recognition by the scientific community.In a collaborative class project, we will identify the best and most representative works for a possible display somewhere on campus.For individual final class projects, students may choose between a research paper and presentation, and their own paleontological artwork in any visual medium.For the latter, students will be able to utilize resources of the Fimbel Maker and Innovation Lab.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesOther

course we will review the history of earth, learn basic geology, and then examine the problem of the origin of animals by studying Mount Holyoke College's superb and unique collection of Proterozoic and Cambrian fossils.The emergence of animals has been called the Cambrian explosion.We will examine what this means for our understanding of evolution as we evaluate hypotheses proposed to explain the relatively sudden appearance of more than half of known animal phyla during the Cambrian event.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveM.McMenaminNotes: May be taken for 200-level credit with permission of instructor.GEOL-133  Mass Extinction, Dinosaurs and Ecological RecoveryNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4Beginning in Precambrian time over a half billion years ago, mass extinctions have periodically decimated earth's biota and left the biosphere in ruins.For example, both the Permo-Triassic and the End-Cretaceous mass extinctions reshaped life on earth and initiated new geological eras.In this course we will examine why mass extinctions occur and study the ways in which the biosphere recovers from mass extinction events.We will also evaluate the claim that we humans are causing a mass extinction and examine proposals regarding the steps we might take to hasten biospheric recovery.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveM.McMenaminPrereq: Any one course in biology, chemistry, environmental studies, geology, or physics.GEOL-137  DinosaursFall.Credits: 4The first dinosaur fossils to be recognized in North America, footprints of the creatures, were found in South Hadley.The very first dinosaur species described by a woman researcher, and one of the most ancient dinosaur species in the United States (Podokesaurus holyokensis), was discovered close to the Mount Holyoke campus.In this course we will learn the main types of non-avian dinosaurs, compare them to other ancient and modern vertebrates, assess their relationship to birds, debate their physiology (cold-blooded or warm blooded?), examine the ecology of the world they inhabited, and by means of field work, rock drilling and excavation, resume the search for a new specimen ofPodokesaurus.To complete the final project, students will select a dinosaur species and study its geological age, geographic distribution, environmental preferences, ecological roles, feeding and reproductive strategies, and body form as they review the history of attempts to reconstruct their adopted dinosaur.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-IntensiveM.McMenaminGEOL-141  Making the Past: Geosciences in the MakerspaceNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4The great German paleontologist Dolf Seilacher once remarked that "drawing enforces careful observation."As a consequence, Seilacher drew all of the illustrations for his influential scientific publications.Taking Seilacher's insight into three dimensions, in this course we will utilize Mount Holyoke's Makerspace to reconstruct ancient organisms.Studies have shown that well-crafted reconstructions of ancient creatures contribute substantially to improved scientific interpretation of their functional morphology, behavior and paleoecological role(s).We will use Makerspace resources, Pixologic's Sculptris, 3D printing and other tools to improve our understanding of the morphologies and activities of ancient organisms, while gleaning information derived from the rock record to analyze their ancient morphologies and behaviors.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesM.McMenaminGEOL-201  Rocks and MineralsSpring.Credits: 4In this course you will learn to

4The surface of the Earth is a history book of past environmental change.Every hill and valley, every erosional feature and every deposit is the result of processes acting at the Earth's surface.In this course we study these processes (e.g.glaciers, rivers, slopes, coastlines, arid regions, frozen ground, cave formation, soil development and groundwater) to understand how they work and to understand the resulting landforms and deposits.With this understanding we can then observe different landforms and deposits and infer past processes (i.e.environments of deposition).Field work and

4Earth's polar environments have undergone rapid change during the 21st century and scientists have generated important new data and made groundbreakinginsights.Using real data, diverse material types, and a range of activities, we have been selected to "Beta-test" education modules designed to teach polar science and polar exploration.Every module uses a combination of 360-degree interactive environment(s), GIS, and other materials to provide students with authentic scientific data and the opportunity to dive into the field experience.According to the PolarPass website, "Each module explores a specific theme, provides a series of units within that theme to walk students through discovery.Learning activities are designed to enhance students' geospatial skills and support development of a sense of polar place, even without traveling to these exciting environments."Note: this is an upper-level climate science course that will involve using real climate and proxy data to better understand past and present climate change.Human dimensions of climate change although incredibly important are not the focus of this course.Applies to requirement(s): Math
