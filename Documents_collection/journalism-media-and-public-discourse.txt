Public DiscourseUndergraduateThe Nexus in Journalism, Media, and Public Discourse encourages you to explore journalism and media through many venues.In the classroom, you can master the nuts and bolts of reporting and fact-checking a news story, examine the history of the New York Times, or analyze the role of media in contemporary society.Nexus Track ChairsProgram OverviewMany departments, including English, history, sociology, and politics, offer hands-on and theory-based courses in journalism and public media.You will learn to examine the world with an educated, critical eye; to collect material from a wide range of sources; and to analyze and communicate information clearly and concisely.Our approach reflects the reality of the job market: employers in journalism and media want students who are knowledgeable and articulate across a wide array of subjects in the liberal arts, who are creative, flexible thinkers with superior writing and analytical capabilities.Program
