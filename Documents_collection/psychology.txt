Psychology Faculty    Psychology Research                Program Overview    We offer courses that cover extensive territory. From Developmental psychology which includes the study of children, adolescents, and life-span issues; Social psychology examines such issues as the psychology of racism, the psychology of women, and the effects of social influence on families and individuals; Personality and abnormal psychology deals with theories of personality, concepts of abnormality, psychoanalytic psychology, and the history of psychoanalysis; to the study of perception and cognition examines how humans learn, think, remember, see, and hear, while the study of the biological bases of behavior looks at comparative animal behavior, behavior neuroscience, and sensory psychology. A hallmark of the curriculum is a series of advanced-level laboratory courses beyond our intermediate-level statistics and research methods courses. Each area of the curriculum has advanced laboratory courses and seminars, providing a very wide range of choice, and requiring hands-on research experience. In addition to our courses, the department emphasizes independent work with faculty, and there is an array of such opportunities, ranging from one-or two-credit experiences for first-year students to honors theses for seniors.

Among the major topics covered are the ways attitudes develop and change; the conditions under which individuals adhere to or deviate from social norms; the behavior of groups; communication; social interaction and interpersonal relationships; and the differences in behavior across gender identities. Personality and Abnormal Psychology  The courses in this area cover the fields of personality, abnormal psychology, and psychotherapy. The field of personality, the systematic study of individual differences and similarities, poses questions such as the following: How is each person unique? In what ways are people alike? Abnormal psychology concerns aspects of human behavior that are maladaptive in a person’s current context. Students concentrating their study in this area are urged to take additional courses in developmental psychology, social psychology, and biological bases of behavior. Developmental and Educational Psychology  Developmental psychology is characterized by a distinct point of view rather than a specific content area. It is concerned with the origins and progressive development over time of perception, thought, language, personality, and social behavior. Educational psychology involves the application of psychology to our understanding of learning, motivation, and teaching, and focuses on both the complex experiences of individual learners and the diverse sociocultural contexts of learning. The courses in developmental and educational psychology reflect this range of topics and also cover the application of developmental theory and findings in education. Students concentrating their study in this area are urged to take courses in as many of the other areas of psychology as possible. Perception and Cognition  The courses in this area are concerned with how we acquire, use, and recollect information. Major topics include visual and auditory perception, learning and memory, and how individuals understand language. Students concentrating their study in this area, especially those with an interest in cognitive neuroscience, are urged to take additional courses in neuroscience and behavior and developmental psychology. Biological Bases of Behavior  The courses in this area adopt the perspective that behavior is the product of biological processes. Major topics include the physiological causes of behavior, the evolutionary history and function of behavior, and the role of learning in modifying behavior. Students concentrating their study in this area are urged to take additional course work in cognition, perception, and language, and in biological sciences.

We will be examining applications to classes of clinical disorders and empirical support for improvement outcomes. Role-playing will be used to illustrate key concepts and approaches to the counseling process. Students will be supported to be reflective and solution focused, evidence-based, process oriented, and to value and facilitate the development of people in the cultural context in which they are embedded. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences J. Tawa Prereq: PSYCH-204 . Advisory: PSYCH-222 recommended. PSYCH-329PR  Seminar in Personality and Abnormal Psychology: 'From Pathology to Resilience: Emotion Regulation, Positive Psychology, and Therapy'  Spring. Credits: 4   The field of psychology has focused predominantly on defining and treating mental illness, rather than the promotion of mental health and resilience broadly. The latter area has tended to be lumped into the idea of "positive psychology." However, this idea of "positive psychology" is narrower in scope than the field of resilience as a whole. Therefore, the course will heavily explore how pop and media presentations of mental health align with the actual clinical science (or not!). Topics will include therapeutic orientations, mindfulness, positive psychology, stress, and behavior change. We will review media sources, books, and peer-reviewed studies. The course will heavily rely on student-led discussions and presentations as well as weekly reflections, essays, and group projects.

Narratives are found throughout our daily lives: in picture books, in videos, and in sharing our personal past. We will examine how they help us find meaning in experiences, the course of their development in different contexts, the role of conversation in learning how to convey narratives, and cultural differences in autobiographical narratives. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences M. Burch Prereq: PSYCH-204 . Perception and Cognition    PSYCH-241  Cognitive Psychology  Spring. Credits: 4   Cognitive psychology is the study of how we sense and interpret information from the world around us, incorporate this new information with our prior experiences, and determine how to respond to an ever-changing environment. Thus, cognition encompasses a range of phenomena that define our mental lives. This course considers empirical investigations and theoretical accounts of cognitive issues, including learning and memory, creativity and problem solving, decision making, attention, consciousness, and language. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences K. Binder Prereq: A 100-level course in psychology or AP Psychology. PSYCH-242  Autobiographical Memory, Identity, and Emotion  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   Autobiographical memories of personal past experiences create our life stories. Our memories range from the mundane to the momentous. In this course we will explore the functions of autobiographical memory as well as its development. What are the basic cognitive processes that contribute to our ability to remember and report the past? How do we interpret past events to inform the development of our self-identity? How do social experiences contribute to the development of memory? We will also discuss how emotions at encoding and retrieval influence our recall of past experience as we make meaning of personal past experiences. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences M. Burch Prereq: A 100-level course in psychology or AP Psychology. PSYCH-243  Memory Systems  Spring. Credits: 4   In this course we will discuss the many types of memory we use daily, from remembering the name of a new friend, a favorite birthday party, or even how to ride a bike. We will explore the constructive nature of memories and how they may change over time as well as how memory capabilities develop over the life course. We will also explore the neurological underpinnings of memory and the limits of our brains' memory systems. However, a background in neuroscience is not necessary. In addition to reading scholarly research and participating in demonstrations of the various forms of memory and their properties, students will be expected to integrate their understanding through a final paper. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences M. Burch Prereq: A 100-level course in psychology or AP Psychology. PSYCH-246  Cognitive Neuroscience  Fall. Credits: 4   Cognitive psychologists investigate the features and functions of the human mind through behavioral techniques; neuroscientists explore the physiology of the human brain. Cognitive Neuroscience lies at the intersection of these disciplines, and asks questions like: How are memories represented in the brain? Is our brain pre-prepared to learn language and if so, how? How does the average human brain still outperform most face recognition software? This course explores the cognitive and neural processes that support vision, attention, language, memory, and music. It introduces basic neuroanatomy, functional imaging techniques, and behavioral measures of cognition. Crosslisted as: NEURO-246 Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences M.

PSYCH-349AM  Seminar in Perception and Cognition: 'Art, Music, and the Brain'  Spring. Credits: 4   Art and music are a part of all human cultures. Is there something about the human brain that drives us to paint and sing? We will examine how the brain simultaneously processes different aspects of visual and auditory stimuli, ask how this processing may affect the way we do art and music, and explore where these phenomena may occur in the brain. As we engage in discussion and hands-on activities, we will discover the commonalities between the arts and the sciences including practice, experimentation, exploration, innovation, and creativity. Crosslisted as: MUSIC-321AM Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive M. Breen, A. Mueller Restrictions: This course is limited to seniors. Instructor permission required. Prereq: At least 8 credits at the 200 level in Psychology, Neuroscience and Behavior, Art History, or Music. PSYCH-349LT  Seminar in Perception and Cognition: 'Language and Thought'  Fall. Credits: 4   Languages differ in the way they describe the world. For example, the noun for bridge is feminine in German, but masculine in French. Russian has two words for blue, while English has only one. The Piraha (an Amazonian hunter-gatherer tribe) arguably have no number words. In this course, we will be asking to what extent these cross-linguistic differences are reflected in thought. That is, do German speakers think bridges are more feminine than French speakers do? Can Russian speakers discriminate different shades of blue better than English speakers? Can the Piraha count? In exploring these questions, we hope to discover how tightly linked language and thought are. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences M. Breen Prereq: PSYCH-204 . Advisory: A 200-level course in Cognitive Psychology recommended. Biological Bases of Behavior    PSYCH-250  Introduction to the Biological Bases of Behavior  Fall and Spring.
