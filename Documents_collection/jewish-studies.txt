time as Jewish communities all over the world creatively interacted with the different cultural and historical milieus in which they lived.This course explores the ways in which Judaism has sought to transform ordinary life into sacred life.What are the ways in which Judaism conceives of God, and what is the meaning of life?What roles do study, prayer, ethics, sex, marriage, family, rituals of the life cycle, and community play in Judaism?These and other questions will be taken up through study of diverse types of religious literature and historical evidence.Crosslisted as:RELIG-112Applies to requirement(s): Humanities; Multicultural PerspectivesM.BenjaminJWST-213  The Gender of YiddishNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4Yiddish and questions of gender have a long history.The language was called "mame-loshn" (mother tongue); it was associated with home and family.Jewish women were the primary intended readers of Yiddish, beginning with religious literature for those who could not read Hebrew and developing into a modern, secular, often moralizing literature.Despite the strong connections between Yiddish and women, women writers have been marginalized and underestimated.This course will explore the gendered history of Yiddish, including through the lens of queer theory.We will also read English translations of literature by modern Yiddish women writers who are being rediscovered today through new translations and scholarly attention.Crosslisted as:GRMST-213,GNDST-210YDApplies to requirement(s): HumanitiesM.CohenNotes: Taught in English.JWST-218  Yiddish Nation: Language as HomelandFall.Credits: 4For roughly 1000 years Ashkenazi Jewish culture has existed in exile.Since these stateless people were living in diaspora, without a sovereign territory, the Yiddish language itself became a symbolic homeland.This course will explore how some Yiddish-speaking Jews embraced their stateless existence not as a historic tragedy but as a revolutionary form of identity called diaspora nationalism.We will explore Yiddish cultural identity through literature, music, film, and politics.We will read works of history and cultural theory and seek points of intersection with other migrant, refugee, stateless, and diasporic cultures.Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesM.CohenNotes: All readings will be in English, prior knowledge of Yiddish is not required.JWST-225  Topics in JudaismJWST-225HC  Topics in Judaism: Remembering the Holocaust in Global Perspectives'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4This seminar explores the impact of different cultural forms of remembering the Holocaust within a global perspective.At the same time that the European Holocaust continues to be remembered, subsequent genocides and related mass violence around the globe are being remembered through multiple forms of memorialization, such as art, film, memorials, and narratives that mirror particular material and virtual forms of remembering the Holocaust.We explore how the interrelationship between Holocaust remembrance and other atrocities drives discussions about subsequent genocides, current antisemitism and racism, and forms of remembering violence.Crosslisted

'The Habsburgs, Hitler, and the Law'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4This course explores the complex, often comic, and ultimately tragic history of Bohemia, a territory located today in the Czech Republic, but previously a part of the Habsburg Monarchy, then of Czechoslovakia, and then of Hitler's Third Reich.Students will complement historical studies with autobiographical material and contemporary fiction, beginning with the Revolution of 1848, progressing through the achievements and worrisome trends of Emperor Francis Joseph's 68-year reign, and concluding with the world wars.Emphasis on the interplay among Czechs, Germans, Jews, and other pivotal players: the House of Habsburg and its supporters, and the political elites of neighboring countries.Crosslisted

terror by the state.More specifically, it examines policies of terror pursued by Communist dictatorships in Hungary and Czechoslovakia during the early years of the Cold War.Who did what to whom, and why?What insights do secret police work and public propaganda, knitted together in macabre show trials, allow us into Stalinist rule, European politics, and maybe ourselves?How did memories of terror shape politics after Stalin's death?Students should deepen their understanding for the discipline of History, improve their reading and writing, and develop a working knowledge of Central European politics at the middle of the twentieth century.Crosslisted as:HIST-262,RES-244STApplies to requirement(s): HumanitiesJ.KingJWST-234  Women and Gender in JudaismFall.Credits: 4This course examines gender as a key category in Jewish religious thought and practice.Students examine different theories of gender and intersectional feminisms, concepts of gender in a range of Jewish sources, and feminist Jewish responses to those sources.Students work with the Judaica collection at the MHC Art Museum and consider material culture as a source for women's and gender studies.Topics may include: how Jewish practice and law regulate sexuality and desire; feminist, queer and trans methods of engaging patriarchal texts; methods of studying women and gender in Jewish cultures;

remembrance since 1945.Crosslisted as:HIST-240Applies to requirement(s): HumanitiesJ.KingJWST-257  OMG: God and Her Critics, from the Bible to Ecological CrisisFall.Credits: 4For a being often said to be immutable, God has been imagined in myriad, often contradictory, ways over the centuries -- even within a single religious tradition.Using Jewish studies as a springboard, this course examines the idea of God through the writings of philosophers and poets, mystics and rationalists from ancient to contemporary times.Topics include: body/spirit dualism and feminist and ecological critique thereof; cross-cultural encounter, diaspora and cultural mixing as generative forces; superstition and other kinds of heterodoxy; and ritual performance.Crosslisted as:RELIG-257Applies to
