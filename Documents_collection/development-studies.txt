development implies use of natural resources and organization of economic activity in ways that can be maintained indefinitely.In order for development to be sustainable, all regions of the world and all social classes must have political and economic agency.This recognizes that as people meet the needs (including social, political, cultural, economic, and health) of current generations without compromising the ability of future generations to also meet their needs, they do so through fair and equitable processes of production, distribution, and consumption.Nexus Track ChairsProgram
