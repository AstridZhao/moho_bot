Schneider,Asian Languages and Literatures, 545-4954Reiko Sono,Asian Languages and Literatures, 545-4947CertificateBecause Buddhist Studies is an interdisciplinary field straddling anthropology, art history, Asian studies, history, language study, literary and textual studies, philosophy and religious studies, students are often unaware of the integrity of the field or of the range of resources available for its study in the Valley.Each student pursuing the Buddhist Studies certificate will choose, in consultation with the Buddhist Studies advisor at his/her college, a course of study comprisingno fewer than seven courses.At least five of these courses should be drawn from theBuddhist Studies courseslisted here on this page (list subject to modification from year to year).Two others may be drawn from this list or may be chosen from elsewhere in the Five Colleges to support the student's Buddhist Studies program from other disciplinary perspectives.Each proposed course of study must be approved by the coordinating committee for the Buddhist Studies certificate.For students who may wish to pursue a certificate in Buddhist Studies as preparation for graduate study in this field,we strongly recommend the study of at least one canonical language(Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese or Tibetan) and/or the modern language of at least one Buddhist culture (especially for those who have an ethnographic interest in Buddhism).Up to two courses in a relevant language can count towards the certificate, although we strongly encourage these students to continue language study beyond the first-year level.Language study is not required, however.Students at all four colleges and the University are eligible for the program.Certificate Requirements:The certificate comprises at least seven courses, at least one of which must be at an advanced level (200 or 300 at Hampshire, 300 or above at Mt Holyoke, Smith, or UMass; comparable upper-level courses at Amherst).Students must take at least one course in three different disciplines of Buddhist Studies (anthropology, art history, Asian studies, philosophy, religious studies, etc.).Students must take at least one course addressing classical Buddhism and one course addressing contemporary Buddhist movements (19th to 21st century), and they must study Buddhism in at least two of the following four geographical areas: South and Southeast Asia, East Asia, the Tibeto-Himalayan region and the West.Up to two canonical or appropriate colloquial Asian language courses may count towards the certificate.Students must receive a grade of at least "B" in each course counting towards the certificate.Courses must be of three credit-hours or more to count towards the certificate.Courses taken abroad or outside the Five Colleges may count towards the certificate only if they would be approved for credit toward the major in the appropriate department of the student's home institution.Exceptions to these requirements by petition to the student's campus advisor and the Five College Buddhist Studies Steering Committee.Interested students should contact a faculty advisor at their campus to enroll in the program.Please be in contact with a faculty advisor on your campus early in your studies to plan your curriculum.Buddhist Studies Certificate Completion FormCoursesNote that if you don't see classes from all campuses currently

students to seek out opportunities for studying abroad.There are many wonderful opportunities for interterm, summer or semester programs in Asia.How do you find a good study abroad program?Start with your campus's Study Abroad website (linked below) for their lists of approved programs for each country you might be interested in.In most cases you are not limited to this list, but if you become interested in a program that is not on your campus's approved list you will need to discuss the program with your campus advisor and the director of the Study Abroad office on your campus to make sure it will be approved.In addition, see below for a list of several study and travel abroad opportunities.Amherst CollegeHampshire CollegeMount Holyoke CollegeSmith CollegeUniversity of Massachusetts

Massachusetts"The Barre Center for Buddhist Studies is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to exploring Buddhist thought and practice as a living tradition, faithful to its origins, yet adaptable to the current world.[...] The study center offers a variety of courses, workshops, retreats and self-study programs to further research, study and practice.Our programming is rooted in the classical Buddhist tradition of the earliest teachings and practices, but calls for dialogue with other schools of Buddhism and with other academic fields.All courses support both silent meditation practice and conscious investigation of the teachings."Insight Meditation SocietyInsight Meditation SocietyBarre, Massachusetts"Primarily, we offer instruction and guidance in insight and loving kindness meditations—practices that help bring genuine happiness to our lives."Vipassana Meditation CenterThe Vipassana Meditation Center (VMC) of Shelburne, MA, offers 10-day residential, silent meditation courses twice monthly to the public without charge on an unsolicited, voluntary, pay-it-forward, donation basis.VMC, in partnership with UMass Amherst, is reserving ten spaces for Pioneer Valley, Massachusetts Five College students, faculty and staff for its August 8thand December 26th2018 courses.Typically, VMC course retreats are full with a waitlist for three months in advance.Vipassana means “to see things as they really are” and is a way of self-transformation through self-observation.It focuses on the deep interconnection between mind and body, which can be experienced directly by disciplined attention to the physical sensations that form the life of the body, and that continuously interconnect and condition the life of the mind.It is this observation-based, self-exploratory journey to the common root of mind and body that gradually dissolves mental impurity, resulting in a balanced mind full of love and compassion.It was rediscovered by Gotama Buddha more than 2,600 years ago and was taught by him as a universal remedy for universal ills, i.e., an art of living.The technique, taught in a non-sectarian manner, aims for the total eradication of mental impurities and the resultant highest happiness of full liberation.To apply for either of the courses, please visithttp://www.dhamma.org/en-US/schedules/schdhara, select either the August 8thor December 26thcourse applications and identify yourself as a Five College student, faculty or staff member in the application.Tibetan language classes with Dara Juels"I have been studying Tibetan Buddhism for the past 15 years with private tutors and teachers including Ka-nying Shedrup Ling in Kathmandu, and I recently completed translator training at Rangung Yeshe Institute in California.Lama Changchup Dorje, my husband, is originally from Mugu, Nepal, and spent 10 years studying at Samye Memorial Gonpa in Kathmandu where he studied Buddhist philosophy and history before undertaking the traditional three-year retreat twice under the guidance of Khenpo Zangpo Rinpoche."I am offering classes in written and spoken Tibetan.The classical component will begin with learning to recognize and write the alphabet, spelling, phonetic decoding and reading simple texts.The spoken component will include writing and reciting simple sentences as well as conversing in Tibetan.Working from theManual of Standard Tibetantextbook, we also will supplement with recordings and transcripts made by my Changchup in order to develop proper pronunciation.In addition, I can also act as an oral interpreter for my husband if further clarification of traditional Buddhist texts is desired."Phone: 413 362-2158Email:dara_juels@yahoo.comContact UsProgram Director:Maria Heim,
