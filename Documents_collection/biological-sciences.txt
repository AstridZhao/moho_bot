Biological Sciences is to stimulate students’ curiosity about the natural world and help them see themselves as scientists, whether they become biology majors or not.Our learning goals for the major are for students to develop fluency with four core concepts of biology:Evolution by natural selection.The relationship between structure and function.Information flow, exchange, and storage.The interconnections between living things and between living things and their environment.Students develop the abilities to closely observe natural phenomena, use evidence in scientific reasoning, and test their own hypotheses about the natural world.They develop biological literacy, following the trains of scientific discovery (and conflict) in the primary literature, and use quantitative methods — including statistics and modeling — to better understand natural phenomena.Biology majors will explore the full range of the discipline and gain ample research and laboratory experience.Ultimately, they are provided with the foundations for success in diverse careers, including medicine, biotechnology, environmental conservation, and public policy.Major RequirementsRequirements for the MajorA

including a fourth 200-level core course, or four credits ofBIOL-395taken in one semester can count toward this elective course requirement.Whether the BIOL-395 counts as a course with or without the lab will be at the discretion of the independent study advisor.3Both of these 300-level courses must be taken at Mount Holyoke.4BIOL-234can satisfy both the calculus/statistics requirement and the requirement of one elective course at the 200- to 300-level, with authorization of the department.Additional SpecificationsA total of six Biological Sciences courses are required to be taken with labs.BIOL-295does not count toward the minimum 32 credits in Biological Sciences nor towards the six courses required to be taken with labs.We encourage students to explore further coursework in math and statistics, chemistry, computer science, physics, philosophy, anthropology, gender studies, and the many other disciplines that intersect with the biological sciences.Students who entered before fall 2023 who have already taken BIOL-230 are advised to complete the major requirements listed in the catalog of their entrance year.Other current students are advised to complete the major requirements listed above.Minor RequirementsRequirements for the MinorA minimum of 16 credits:Course ListCodeTitleCredits16 credits in Biological Sciences at the 200 and/or 300 level1,216Total

and Mathematics II Distribution RequirementMost departmental courses satisfy the science and mathematics distribution requirement.Any off-campus biology course taken to satisfy the science and mathematics distribution requirement requirement must have a laboratory component.Courses that are introductions to professional specialties dependent on biology (e.g., nutrition or horticulture), or are addressed to technical certification (e.g., emergency medical technician), do not satisfy the science and mathematics distribution requirement.Introductory BiologyThe department offers introductory biology in two different forms.TheBIOL-145courses (e.g.BIOL-145AB,BIOL-145GW, etc.)are a liberal arts introduction to biology in a small-class atmosphere.Different sections emphasize different topics.BIOL-160, which must be taken concurrently withCHEM-160, offers an integrated introduction to biology and chemistry.Either one is an appropriate choice for students who are considering a major in biology, biochemistry, or environmental studies.Completion of any of these courses will allow a student to enroll inBIOL-200.Students are welcome to email the instructors to find out more about any of the introductory courses.Course Advice for MajorsMajors are strongly encouraged to complete the following course work outside of biological sciences: Organic Chemistry (CHEM-202andCHEM-302), as well as additional coursework in Physics and Computer Science.It is not difficult to major in Biological Sciences and go off-campus for one or two semesters.For instance, other places are better situated to study tropical rain forests, deserts, or the ocean.Students have also received credit toward the biology major for course work done in French at partner universities in Montpellier.Mount Holyoke College has special relationships with several other programs abroad.It is not safe to assume, however, that biology courses taken through any program off-campus will count toward requirements of the Biology major.Before enrolling in study away from the College, it is essential to talk about your goals and specific plans with the Chair of Biology or a designated faculty member.Course OfferingsBIOL-145  Introductory BiologyBIOL-145AB  Introductory Biology: 'Animal Bodies, Animal Functions'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4How are animal bodies

Course: 'Molecular Genetics and Human Genetic Disorders'Fall.Credits: 4Mendel's principles of genetic inheritance underpin all the inheritance patterns that we observe and the traits they govern.However, in nature, not all is as it first appears.Many traits seem to diverge from Mendelian genetics until we understand those inheritance patterns more deeply.In this course, we will explore the depths of genetic inheritance by first understanding the mechanisms of these seeming "exceptions of Mendelian inheritance".We will then understand how the molecule of DNA behaves in the nucleus to allow for gene expression and how we study DNA in the lab.Finally, we will discuss human genetic disorders that occur because of deviations in gene expression or DNA behavior but are rooted in Mendelian genetic principles.The capstone experience of the course is a student-group project exploring experimental approaches for diagnosing or treating a human genetic disorder.Applies to

when, and how plants are geographically distributed?In this course, we focus on this question by examining plant geographic patterns on both global and local scales.We explore how abiotic and biotic factors affect historical, present, and potential future plant distributions.Together we engage primary literature on topics such as island biogeography, climate change effects on species persistence, and contemporary influences of humans on the movement of plants.In lab we use analytical tools such as phylogenetics and ecological niche modeling to investigate the intersections between plant evolution, geography, and climate change.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesC.DrummondPrereq: 8 credits at the 200 level in Biological Sciences or equivalent.Coreq: BIOL-321PBL.BIOL-321PR  Conference Course: 'Pregnancy and the Placenta'Spring.Credits: 4Pregnancy is a stunning feat of physiology.It is a conversation between two bodies -- parental and fetal -- whose collective action blurs the very boundaries of the individual.In this course we will explore such questions as: what is pregnancy, and how does the ephemeral, essential organ known as the placenta call pregnancy into being?How is pregnancy sustained?How does it end?We will consider the anatomy of reproductive systems and the hormonal language of reproduction.We will investigate the nature of "sex" hormones, consider racial disparities in pregnancy outcome, and weigh the evidence that the intrauterine environment influences disease susceptibility long after birth.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-IntensiveS.BaconPrereq: 8 credits at the 200 level in Biological Sciences.BIOL-321RB  Conference Course: 'Race and Biology'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4In this student-centered, discussion-based seminar, we will explore current hypotheses about the evolution of human variation, trace the history of how biology has been used in the construction of racial ideologies, and delve into the impacts of racial categorization on human health.We will investigate these themes through readings, videos, class discussions, student expert panels, and research papers.Students taking this course will improve their ability to: engage constructively in scholarly discussions; use verbal and written discourse to explore themes in science; use new knowledge to understand current issues; critically evaluate media information using evidence from scientific studies; and communicate new knowledge.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesR.BrodiePrereq: 4

succeeded in immunizing against these pathogens but not HIV or the common cold?Students in this seminar will discuss primary literature in immunology, microbiology, and epidemiology to learn how vaccines outsmart pathogens.Study of biological mechanisms will be complemented with exploration of the socioeconomic factors that influence vaccine development and usage.Students' independent research will connect their interests and current events to course concepts.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesR.LijekPrereq: BIOL-230 or bothBIOL-210andBIOL-220.BIOL-322  Comparative BiomechanicsSpring.Credits: 4The main objective of this course is to explore organismal structure and function via an examination of the basic physical principles that guide how living things are constructed and how organisms interact with their environment.We will use the combined approaches of the biologist and engineer to study the impact of size on biological systems, address the implications of solid and fluid mechanics for animal design, survey different modes of animal locomotion, and learn how biologists working in diverse areas (e.g., ecology, development, evolution, and physiology) gain insight through biomechanical analyses.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesG.GillisPrereq: 8 credits from Biological Sciences exceptBIOL-200.BIOL-323  Plant Growth and DevelopmentNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4This course is a study of the higher plant, its structure, organization, and development.We will examine the endogenous and environmental factors influencing plant growth and reproduction.Topics include anatomy, hormones and their mode of action, tropisms, photomorphogenesis, and flowering.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesA.FraryPrereq:BIOL-200and two other courses at the 200-level in Biological Sciences.BIOL-325  Plant Diversity and EvolutionFall.Credits: 4This course explores the tremendous diversity of the

prominently bacteria.Other microbes, including archaea, eukaryotic microbes, and viruses will also be considered.Whenever possible, the relationship between microbes and humans will be highlighted.Other goals will be for students to become comfortable with scientific primary literature and to hone their communication skills through discussions and written assignments.Finally, the laboratory portion of this course will highlight classic and modern techniques in microbiology.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesThe departmentPrereq:BIOL-210,BIOL-220, or BIOL-230.Coreq: BIOL-327L.BIOL-328  Human PhysiologyNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4In this class we will learn about the functions of human organ systems and their relationships with each other in health and disease, at both the cellular and tissue levels.We will study the mechanisms that regulate a variety of organ systems and learn how these mechanisms respond to the changing needs of the individual.Because a purely reductive approach often misses important determinants of body function, we will also consider how human health and disease unfold in a person's particular social and cultural context.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesS.BaconPrereq:BIOL-220, BIOL-230, orBIOCH-311.Coreq: BIOL-328L.BIOL-331  Conservation BiologyNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4This course focuses on advanced ecological theory applied to conservation.Class will combine lectures and discussions of primary scientific literature.Because Conservation Biology is an applied discipline, we will explore the nuances of management effects in different situations as well as the role of humans in the decline of biodiversity.This year this course will not have a separate lab section or count as a lab course, but the course will still include a large final project that can be collaborative and community-based.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesOther Attribute(s):

underlying the generation of the nerve impulse and synaptic transmission.We will then explore neuroanatomy, diseases of the brain and the neuronal circuits underlying learning and memory and sensory perception.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesA.WhiteRestrictions: This course is open to juniors and seniorsPrereq: 4 credits from Chemistry or Physics andBIOL-210, BIOL-230.Coreq:  BIOL-333L.Notes: Preference given to seniorsBIOL-337  Symbiotic InteractionsSpring.Credits: 4From mutualism to parasitism, symbiotic interactions are a universal feature of life.In this seminar we will study the mechanisms underlying symbiotic interactions and consider their significance for the ecology and evolution of organisms.Through foundational texts and current scientific literature, we will explore some of the most spectacular and important examples of contemporary symbioses - from infectious diseases to coral reefs, to infectious diseases, to the vast communities of microbes that live on and in our bodies - and we will learn how symbiosis is responsible for major milestones in the history of life, such as the origin of the eukaryotic cell, the emergence of land plants, and the evolution of sex.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveJ.AndrasPrereq:BIOL-223orBIOL-226.BIOL-340  Eukaryotic Molecular
