Our learning goals for the major are for students to develop fluency with four core concepts of biology:  Evolution by natural selection. The relationship between structure and function. Information flow, exchange, and storage. The interconnections between living things and between living things and their environment. Students develop the abilities to closely observe natural phenomena, use evidence in scientific reasoning, and test their own hypotheses about the natural world. They develop biological literacy, following the trains of scientific discovery (and conflict) in the primary literature, and use quantitative methods — including statistics and modeling — to better understand natural phenomena. Biology majors will explore the full range of the discipline and gain ample research and laboratory experience. Ultimately, they are provided with the foundations for success in diverse careers, including medicine, biotechnology, environmental conservation, and public policy.

Whether the BIOL-395 counts as a course with or without the lab will be at the discretion of the independent study advisor. 3 Both of these 300-level courses must be taken at Mount Holyoke. 4 BIOL-234 can satisfy both the calculus/statistics requirement and the requirement of one elective course at the 200- to 300-level, with authorization of the department. Additional Specifications  A total of six Biological Sciences courses are required to be taken with labs. BIOL-295 does not count toward the minimum 32 credits in Biological Sciences nor towards the six courses required to be taken with labs. We encourage students to explore further coursework in math and statistics, chemistry, computer science, physics, philosophy, anthropology, gender studies, and the many other disciplines that intersect with the biological sciences. Students who entered before fall 2023 who have already taken BIOL-230 are advised to complete the major requirements listed in the catalog of their entrance year. Other current students are advised to complete the major requirements listed above. Minor Requirements        Requirements for the Minor  A minimum of 16 credits:  Course List  Code  Title  Credits  16 credits in Biological Sciences at the 200 and/or 300 level  1,2 16 Total Credits 16  1 BIOL-295 and BIOL-395 do not count toward the minimum 16 credits in the minor. 2 At least eight credits must be taken at Mount Holyoke. Courses        Course Advice  Credit in Biology towards the Science and Mathematics II Distribution Requirement  Most departmental courses satisfy the science and mathematics distribution requirement. Any off-campus biology course taken to satisfy the science and mathematics distribution requirement requirement must have a laboratory component. Courses that are introductions to professional specialties dependent on biology (e.g., nutrition or horticulture), or are addressed to technical certification (e.g., emergency medical technician), do not satisfy the science and mathematics distribution requirement. Introductory Biology  The department offers introductory biology in two different forms. The BIOL-145 courses (e.g. BIOL-145AB , BIOL-145GW , etc.) are a liberal arts introduction to biology in a small-class atmosphere. Different sections emphasize different topics. BIOL-160 , which must be taken concurrently with CHEM-160 , offers an integrated introduction to biology and chemistry. Either one is an appropriate choice for students who are considering a major in biology, biochemistry, or environmental studies. Completion of any of these courses will allow a student to enroll in BIOL-200 . Students are welcome to email the instructors to find out more about any of the introductory courses. Course Advice for Majors  Majors are strongly encouraged to complete the following course work outside of biological sciences: Organic Chemistry ( CHEM-202 and CHEM-302 ), as well as additional coursework in Physics and Computer Science. It is not difficult to major in Biological Sciences and go off-campus for one or two semesters. For instance, other places are better situated to study tropical rain forests, deserts, or the ocean. Students have also received credit toward the biology major for course work done in French at partner universities in Montpellier. Mount Holyoke College has special relationships with several other programs abroad. It is not safe to assume, however, that biology courses taken through any program off-campus will count toward requirements of the Biology major. Before enrolling in study away from the College, it is essential to talk about your goals and specific plans with the Chair of Biology or a designated faculty member.

Notes: Biology 223 and/or Biology 226 must be taken for the Biology major. BIOL-226  Evolution: Making Sense of Life  Spring. Credits: 4   Evolution is central to our understanding of Biology; it helps us explain both the diversity and commonality in organismal form, function and behavior that have been generated over 3 billion years of life on Earth. We will discuss the mechanisms of evolution within populations and between species, examine some branches of the tree of life and learn how the tree is generated, discuss how phenotypes arise from genotypes and interactions with the environment, and how development is central to understanding evolution. Some themes include the evolution of symbiosis, sex, and human evolution, as well as the crucial role that evolutionary principles play in society including agriculture, medicine, and even the judicial system. Applies to requirement(s): Math  Sciences P. Brennan Prereq: BIOL-200 , BIOL-210 , BIOL-220 , BIOL-223 or BIOL-230. Coreq: BIOL-226L.

BIOL-234  Biostatistics  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   The statistics sections of biology articles have become so technical and jargon-filled that many biologists feel intimidated into skipping them or blindly accepting the stated results. But how can we ask relevant questions or push the boundaries of knowledge if we skip these sections? Using lectures, data collection, and hands-on analysis in R, this course will connect statistics to biology to help students develop a gut instinct for experimental design and analysis. We will explore sampling bias and data visualization and review methods and assumptions for the most common approaches with examples from current biological literature and our own data. Applies to requirement(s): Math  Sciences M. Hoopes Prereq: 8 credits in biological sciences or ENVST-200 . Coreq: BIOL-234L. BIOL-241  Comparative Animal Physiology  Spring. Credits: 4   Animals share needs such as eating, breathing, moving and reproducing. Yet their solutions to meeting these needs are incredibly diverse, constrained as they are by each group's evolutionary history and by the specific demands of the environment in which they live. By looking at the range of solutions animals have devised to navigate life on earth, we will explore fundamental themes in physiology including homeostasis and the relationship between structure and function. Using lectures, readings and discussions, students will gain an appreciation for the remarkably diverse ways in which animals have evolved to overcome the fundamental challenges of life. Applies to requirement(s): Math  Sciences S. Bacon, G. Gillis Prereq: BIOL-145 , BIOL-160 , or NEURO-100 , and BIOL-200 . BIOL-249  The Naturalist Habit  Fall.

For example, midges flap their wings at up to 1000 Hz; bar-headed geese migrate over Mount Everest; deep-sea fish withstand pressures near 300 atmospheres; certain frogs can allow their body temperatures to drop below 0 degrees Celsius. Through readings and discussions we will explore the diverse mechanisms that underlie how organisms reach extreme levels of performance and survive in extreme environments. Applies to requirement(s): Math  Sciences G. Gillis Prereq: BIOL-220 or 230 and one additional Biological Sciences course above 200. BIOL-321HG  Conference Course: 'Molecular Genetics and Human Genetic Disorders'  Fall. Credits: 4   Mendel's principles of genetic inheritance underpin all the inheritance patterns that we observe and the traits they govern. However, in nature, not all is as it first appears. Many traits seem to diverge from Mendelian genetics until we understand those inheritance patterns more deeply. In this course, we will explore the depths of genetic inheritance by first understanding the mechanisms of these seeming "exceptions of Mendelian inheritance". We will then understand how the molecule of DNA behaves in the nucleus to allow for gene expression and how we study DNA in the lab. Finally, we will discuss human genetic disorders that occur because of deviations in gene expression or DNA behavior but are rooted in Mendelian genetic principles. The capstone experience of the course is a student-group project exploring experimental approaches for diagnosing or treating a human genetic disorder. Applies to requirement(s): Math  Sciences T. Mennella Prereq: BIOL-200 and BIOL-230. BIOL-321ME  Conference Course: 'Molecular Ecology'  Spring. Credits: 4   Over the past quarter century, molecular genetic methods have become increasingly important in ecological research. In this course, we will examine contemporary molecular genetic tools and learn how they can be used to answer ecological questions. Topics will include: reconstruction of ancestral relationships; measuring the size, diversity, and spatial structure of populations; characterization of migration and dispersal patterns; and identification of sensitive or threatened species and populations. We will explore these themes through foundational texts and current scientific literature, and we will analyze molecular genetic datasets in class to gain familiarity with available techniques.

BIOL-321MR  Conference Course: 'Marine Invertebrate Physiology'  Fall. Credits: 4   Invertebrates are an incredibly diverse group of organisms that live in nearly all ecosystems across the earth. As ectotherms, invertebrates must develop plastic responses to environmental variation in order to survive. In this course, we will explore these plastic responses in marine invertebrates at all levels of organization -- from cellular to ecosystem scales -- through hands-on activities, projects, and synthesis of primary literature. Applies to requirement(s): Math  Sciences J. Baumann Prereq: 8 credits at the 200 level in Biological Sciences. Coreq: BIOL-321MRL. BIOL-321PB  Conference Course: 'Plant Biogeography'  Spring. Credits: 4   What roles do ecology and evolution play in shaping where, when, and how plants are geographically distributed? In this course, we focus on this question by examining plant geographic patterns on both global and local scales. We explore how abiotic and biotic factors affect historical, present, and potential future plant distributions. Together we engage primary literature on topics such as island biogeography, climate change effects on species persistence, and contemporary influences of humans on the movement of plants. In lab we use analytical tools such as phylogenetics and ecological niche modeling to investigate the intersections between plant evolution, geography, and climate change.

BIOL-321PR  Conference Course: 'Pregnancy and the Placenta'  Spring. Credits: 4   Pregnancy is a stunning feat of physiology. It is a conversation between two bodies -- parental and fetal -- whose collective action blurs the very boundaries of the individual. In this course we will explore such questions as: what is pregnancy, and how does the ephemeral, essential organ known as the placenta call pregnancy into being? How is pregnancy sustained? How does it end? We will consider the anatomy of reproductive systems and the hormonal language of reproduction. We will investigate the nature of "sex" hormones, consider racial disparities in pregnancy outcome, and weigh the evidence that the intrauterine environment influences disease susceptibility long after birth.

BIOL-321RB  Conference Course: 'Race and Biology'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   In this student-centered, discussion-based seminar, we will explore current hypotheses about the evolution of human variation, trace the history of how biology has been used in the construction of racial ideologies, and delve into the impacts of racial categorization on human health. We will investigate these themes through readings, videos, class discussions, student expert panels, and research papers. Students taking this course will improve their ability to: engage constructively in scholarly discussions; use verbal and written discourse to explore themes in science; use new knowledge to understand current issues; critically evaluate media information using evidence from scientific studies; and communicate new knowledge. Applies to requirement(s): Math  Sciences R. Brodie Prereq: 4 credits of Biological Sciences at the 200 level. BIOL-321VX  Conference Course: 'Outsmarting Pathogens'  Fall. Credits: 4   Smallpox, a disfiguring infection called "one of the most devastating diseases known to humanity" by the World Health Organization, was eradicated from the planet through immunization. Polio paralyzed 350,000 children a year until immunization reduced infection by 99%. Why have we succeeded in immunizing against these pathogens but not HIV or the common cold? Students in this seminar will discuss primary literature in immunology, microbiology, and epidemiology to learn how vaccines outsmart pathogens. Study of biological mechanisms will be complemented with exploration of the socioeconomic factors that influence vaccine development and usage. Students' independent research will connect their interests and current events to course concepts. Applies to requirement(s): Math  Sciences R. Lijek Prereq: BIOL-230 or both BIOL-210 and BIOL-220 .
