OverviewOn campus, our students experience regional culture at many levels, including language tables and clubs, guest lectures, performing and visual arts, film, festivals, and regional cuisine.These activities are often initiated by and benefit greatly from the diverse student population of Mount Holyoke and particularly the large numbers of students from Asian countries or with an Asian background.Most of our students spend a semester or a summer in one of the many Mount Holyoke College-approved South Asian study abroad programs.South Asian studies majors graduate to pursue graduate study and careers in fields as varied as education, business, NGOs, journalism, the arts, and government service.Program InformationProgram TypeMajorOutcomeBachelor of ArtsDepartmentDepartment of
