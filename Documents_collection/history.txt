History Faculty    History Research           Program Overview    Using evidence from the past, historians investigate the relationship between cause and effect and between agency and responsibility to understand better how things change over time. These general habits of sorting through the past allow us to appreciate the profound differences between ourselves and others and to imagine (and to some degree experience) the world as people have in times now lost and in places we shall never see. If you wish to major in history you would typically declare your intention sometime in the fourth semester of College. The requirements for a major in history emphasize both a broad exposure to different time periods and regions of the world, as well as a rigorous engagement with the practice of history as a discipline grounded in the use of primary sources. Historians can be found in many guises, including in other departments: Geoffrey S. Sumi , Professor of Classics, Lauret Savoy , Professor of Environmental Studies and Paula Debnar , Professor of Classics are all faculty affiliated with the history department. Taking history courses offered through the five college campuses and the Hampshire Colleges History Department , Amherst College Department of History , Smith College Department of History and the University of Massachusetts Amherst Department of History also offer many additional opportunities.

There are as many answers to this question as there are stories to be told of the past, but the American Historical Association’s “Tuning Project” – developed with the help of Mount Holyoke College history alum professor Anne Hyde ‘82 — offers a clear and compelling statement on the value and skills of historical thinking.

More advanced levels do often involve heavier reading and writing assignments, but critical reading and clear writing are valued in all history courses, and the distinction between levels is often as much about the kinds of questions asked as the level of rigor involved. Many courses can be taken without any prerequisites. First Year Seminars are only open to first-year students and introduce history as a field of inquiry and stress the development of basic writing, arguing and research methods. 100-level regional surveys focus on particular geographic areas; they have no prerequisites and are open to all students. 200-level courses examine particular times and places in history and range in size from large survey courses to small seminars. In most cases, all students are welcome to enroll. 300-level courses (colloquium and research seminars) offer opportunities to examine topics in depth; some do have prerequisites or require permission of the instructor. If permission is required, please complete and submit the 300-Level Application Form. Take one history course and you will undoubtedly want to take more! Selecting your first history course  You may prefer to start with the kind of broad introduction available in a survey, to learn about the diversity of peoples, places, and ways of living that have come before us and out of which the world as we know it has emerged. Or you may prefer to dive into an area of history that seems particularly intriguing or relevant to your interests, and perhaps turn to one or another survey later to gain a broader understanding of the past. Since history always involves the interplay between broad contexts and particular places in time, you can begin on either end of the spectrum. You are not required to begin at the 100 level. Selecting courses in your first year  These fall courses are recommended for first-year students:  Surveys  HIST-124-01 History of Modern South Asia, 1700 to the Present  HIST-137-01 Modern East Asia, 1600-2000  HIST-141-01 Introduction to Modern African History  HIST-142-01 Introduction to Pre-colonial African History  HIST-151-01 Modern & Contemporary Europe  HIST-171-01 The American Peoples Since 1865  HIST-180-01 Introduction to Latin American Cultures             Courses and Requirements    Generally speaking, history courses are reading and writing intensive. To succeed as a student of history, you must, therefore learn to read actively and write clearly. Learning Goals  Major Requirements  Minor Requirements  Courses      Learning Goals        Learning Goals  Students of the History department can expect to:  Understand the dynamics of change over time, the complexity of human experience across time and space, and the ways people both shape and are shaped by the particular worlds they inhabit. Evaluate a wide range of historical materials for their credibility, position, and perspective, and for the clues they offer about past worlds and experiences. Discern from such fragmentary evidence meaningful patterns that illuminate our understanding of the past. Develop empathy for the people whose lives we seek to understand and a respectful appreciation of the range and diversity of human experience. Generate significant, open-ended questions, and devise research strategies to find suitable evidence to answer such questions. Engage in lively, meaningful conversation about the nature of historical inquiry and conflicting understandings of the past. Work cooperatively with others to develop positions that reflect deliberation and differing perspectives. Write effective and logical prose that describes and analyzes the past, and consider a range of media best suited to communicating a particular argument, narrative, or set of ideas. Develop a disciplined, inquiring stance and outlook on the world that demands evidence and sophisticated use of information. Apply historical knowledge and historical thinking to contemporary issues.

Additional Specifications   The department encourages students to pursue independent work at the 300 level during the senior year. Students who intend to pursue independent work in the senior year should plan to complete their research seminar during the junior year. Students interested in senior independent work, who also plan junior years at institutions other than Mount Holyoke College, will need to take special care to meet this requirement. Minor Requirements        Requirements for the Minor  A minimum of 20 credits:  Course List  Code  Title  Credits  One research seminar, taken in the department (any course numbered between 302–394) 4 Four other courses above the 100 level 16 Total Credits 20       Courses        Course Offerings  Jump to: First-Year Seminars 100-Level Regional Surveys 200-Level Courses: Themes and Periods 300-Level Colloquia Research Seminars Independent Study  First-Year Seminars  First-Year Seminars taught by History faculty introduce history as a method of inquiry, analysis, and interpretation concerned with understanding the variety of past human experience and with communicating that understanding clearly. The limited enrollment of these course permits a concentration on the close reading and analysis of secondary and primary texts, and on the process of writing and revision. The substantial concentration on writing qualifies such seminars as writing-intensive courses. All first-year seminars are listed together under First Year Seminars . 100-Level Regional Surveys  The department’s 100-level survey courses are designed both for students seeking an introduction to a particular geographic area new to them and, equally, for students wishing to pursue intermediate or advanced work in a particular field. Students interested in pursuing American or European history, for example, are advised to take the pertinent survey as preparation for more advanced work, just as those interested in Africa, Asia, or Latin America should take the survey in their chosen area of interest. HIST-124  History of Modern South Asia, 1700 to the Present  Fall. Credits: 4   This course will explore the history of South Asia between the eighteenth century and the present. Using a combined chronological and thematic approach and against a historical canvas that engages such diverse issues as gender, political economy, conquest, resistance, state formation, economic exploitation, national liberation, and identity politics, the aim of this course is to interrogate the impact of British colonialism and South Asian nationalisms on the state, society, and people of the subcontinent.

HIST-239ME  Topics in Asian History: 'Cities in Modern East Asia'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   This course asks: what are cities in the history of modern East Asia? Cities were cosmopolitan, centers of commerce, and sites of social movements in late imperial China, Tokugawa Japan, and late Chosǔn Korea. How did the roles of cities change in the nineteenth century when East Asia became more integrated into the global system? How was urban life affected in the first half of the twentieth century when the central states dealt with domestic turmoil and external pressures? How did the state work to redefine cities and urban culture in the postwar era? To answer these questions, this seminar encourages students to position cities historically and comparatively.

Millions living along its vast coastline face the imminent danger of being reduced to climate refugees. In such times, how might we understand the longer history of environmental change in South Asia? This course traces shifts in how people in the region have understood the environment -- as a source of sustenance, a resource ripe for domination, and an entity in need of saving. Drawing from histories of agriculture, public works, and forestry, it interrogates how transnational forces such as colonial capitalism and geopolitics have shaped local interactions between humans, nature, and animals.

Is it the same in all times and places? If money could speak, what stories would it tell of the past? This course is about the history of money and money as an object of history. Using primary and secondary sources, students will learn about the social, political and cultural meaning of money at different times in the history of the western world. In addition, students will interpret the history of money using a variety of coins and money-related objects held in the MHC Art Museum. This is a course on the history of money, not the economics of money, but it will be of interest to anyone curious to learn more about the meaning of money in the past and today.

Fitz-Gibbon  HIST-253HE  Topics in History: 'The Hellenistic World from Alexander to Cleopatra'  Fall. Credits: 4   An introduction to the history and legends of Alexander the Great and Cleopatra VII through an analysis of the surviving historical and literary evidence. By spreading Greek culture from northern Greece as far as modern Pakistan, Alexander transformed much of the known world, which witnessed changes in politics and imperialism, literature and science, as well as in the lives of women. This diverse and dynamic world produced Cleopatra VII who endeavored to preserve her dynasty amid the growing power of the Roman Empire. This course concludes with the enduring legacies of Alexander and Cleopatra in modern times. Crosslisted as: CLASS-239HE Applies to requirement(s): Humanities G. Sumi Notes: Meets history department's pre-1750 requirement. HIST-253SP  Topics in History: 'The Spartans: Myth and History'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   In contrast to democratic Athens, oligarchic Sparta was renowned for its secrecy and skillful use of propaganda. Thus, it presents difficult challenges for historical study. In this course we will try to peer behind the "Spartan mirage" to determine how much the Spartans really differed from other ancient Greeks. We will then try to understand the use of Spartans as models for later polities and for groups like the Nazis and Alt-right. Topics: government, education, and citizenship; the role of women, eugenics, and slavery; the use and misuse of the image of Sparta. Readings will include Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, and modern scholarship on specific topics. Crosslisted as: CLASS-253 Applies to requirement(s): Humanities P. Debnar Notes: Meets history department's pre-1750 requirement  HIST-255  Ideas and Society in Europe      HIST-257  City Life in Modern Europe, 1750-1914  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   "Our age is ... the age of great cities," wrote Robert Vaughan in 1843. Many Europeans questioned whether the greatness of cities was such a good thing, but most agreed that the history of nineteenth-century Europe could not be written without them. We will examine that history from the perspective of Europe's largest cities between the mid-eighteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Readings will explore the process of urban transformation, the new forms of experience and identity that emerged in city life, and the efforts of governments, social reformers, planners and engineers to control and discipline the new urban masses.

Fitz-Gibbon  HIST-258  Travel, Self, Identity between Europe and South Asia  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   With the discovery of a maritime route between Europe and India in 1498, an increasing number of Europeans traveled to South Asia, for commerce, on missionary activity, to collect plants, and as part of colonial enterprises. From about 1600, South Asian elites, and, later, anti-colonial leaders, soldiers, and students, among others, journeyed in the opposite direction. Tracing a long history of cross-cultural contact, this seminar examines the role of travel in fashioning notions of self and "other". It asks how travel narratives visualize place and people, in what ways gender mediates experiences of travel, and how these encounters help reveal what is common and different between cultures.

Credits: 4   What world gave rise to Mary Lyon's vision for Mount Holyoke and enabled her to carry her plans to success? Has her vision persisted or been overturned? We will examine the conditions, assumptions, and exclusions that formed Mount Holyoke and the arrangements of power and struggles for justice that shaped it during and after Lyon's lifetime. Topics include settler colonialism and missionary projects; northern racism and abolitionism; industrial capitalism and the evolution of social classes; debates over women's education, gender, and body politics; religious diversity; and efforts to achieve a just and inclusive campus.

Credits: 4   This course explores the complex, often comic, and ultimately tragic history of Bohemia, a territory located today in the Czech Republic, but previously a part of the Habsburg Monarchy, then of Czechoslovakia, and then of Hitler's Third Reich. Students will complement historical studies with autobiographical material and contemporary fiction, beginning with the Revolution of 1848, progressing through the achievements and worrisome trends of Emperor Francis Joseph's 68-year reign, and concluding with the world wars. Emphasis on the interplay among Czechs, Germans, Jews, and other pivotal players: the House of Habsburg and its supporters, and the political elites of neighboring countries.

Credits: 4   This course explores the use of revolutionary terror by the state. More specifically, it examines policies of terror pursued by Communist dictatorships in Hungary and Czechoslovakia during the early years of the Cold War. Who did what to whom, and why? What insights do secret police work and public propaganda, knitted together in macabre show trials, allow us into Stalinist rule, European politics, and maybe ourselves? How did memories of terror shape politics after Stalin's death? Students should deepen their understanding for the discipline of History, improve their reading and writing, and develop a working knowledge of Central European politics at the middle of the twentieth century.

Credits: 4   During the Cold War, as tensions raged between the U.S. and Soviet Union, policymakers of both ideological persuasions oversaw rural development projects across the Third World. Their actions were premised on knowledge that villages were underdeveloped places. Mainly a colonial idea, this thought also had curious antecedents such as the Indian anti-colonialist Gandhi who saw villages as reservoirs of tradition and bulwarks against modernity. This course questions the received wisdom of this dichotomy. Drawing on classic works and case studies from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, it asks how the city and countryside became symbols for understanding social and economic development.

Credits: 4   This course considers the historical evolution of women's private lives, public presence, and political engagement within and beyond the borders of the United States, from the 1890s to the present. How have U.S. racism, consumer capitalism, immigration, and changing forms of state power shaped women's experiences and possibilities? How have regimes of gender, sexuality, bodily comportment, and reproduction evolved in relation to national and global changes? Emphasis will be placed on the experiences and perspectives of working-class women, women of color, and colonized women.

Credits: 4   We live in an age of energy crises, in which the future of energy is questioned in countless headlines and Twitter feeds. These concerns often include other assumptions about energy's past, in particular the idea that social change invariably follows the discovery of new energy technologies. From food to fuel cells, this colloquium charts a more complicated and interesting history, a history in which people have continually shaped and made meaningful the energies that fuel the modern world.

Credits: 4   How have Americans -- and those contending with America -- envisioned and reached for more just and inclusive communities? What historical circumstances have opened opportunities for more robust democratic forms to emerge in the face of oppression? We will consider structural barriers to meaningful inclusion, involving racism, wealth, poverty, property, citizenship, gender, sexuality, disability, and dissent, as well as efforts to overcome them through concerted action and cultural struggle in the arts and public humanities. What public stories shape our connections with one another? What can we learn about the possibilities for sustaining democracy through daily life and culture?

Credits: 4   The recession of 2008 has drawn scholars to the subject of long-term capitalist transformation around the globe. Examining the phenomenon that is 'global capitalism,' they have studied its effects on markets, structures of government, and increasingly, the environment. A global approach, however, is inadequate for understanding the particular lifeworlds shaped by capitalism at the local and regional levels. This colloquium uses examples from South Asia to emphasize how capitalist transition in the region was entangled with developments elsewhere, yet asserted a quite distinctive influence in areas of trade, agriculture, property norms, law, labor relations, migration, and consumption.
