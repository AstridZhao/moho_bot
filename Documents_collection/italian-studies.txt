Classics and Italian Faculty    Giamatti Lecture and Dante Collection           Program Overview    At Mount Holyoke College, our Italian faculty are a small group of dedicated professors and scholars. Rather than simply teaching a language, we teach you a whole culture and support your professional growth through language programs and internships in Italy. We keep our courses small and create a warm, supportive community that welcomes all students interested in Italian language and culture. Italian is renowned as the language of the arts, music, and opera. In the third millennium, at the crossroads of Mediterranean culture, Italy is quickly becoming a multicultural nation, with one of the top ten economies in the world. It is a leader in design, fashion, food and wine as well as in engineering, aerospace and medicine. The ability to speak, read and understand Italian and to have first-hand experience in Italian culture is vital and relevant in today’s interconnected global economies. A major in Italian can lead to a variety of national and international careers in foreign service, international banking and trade, fashion marketing, film, journalism, and teaching. Valuable experience can be gained through the many study abroad options available to Italian majors in Florence, Bologna, Padova, and Ferrara, among others.
