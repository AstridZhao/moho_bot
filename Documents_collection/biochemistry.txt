of reactions that underpin the living system.These include the vital metabolic reactions that provide cells with energy to perform myriad activities and functions, and the biosynthetic reactions that enable cells to renew, repair, grow, and divide.Biochemistry FacultyBiochemistry ResearchProgram OverviewThe major in biochemistry is intended to provide a strong background in the fundamentals of both biology and chemistry and to develop an awareness of the unique principles of biochemistry.The linkage of biochemistry with molecular biology for the past 30 years has brought revolutionary advances in our understanding of the living world, the human organism, disease etiology, and medicine.The interdisciplinary major in biochemistry offers a rigorous course of study that builds on two years of fundamental course work in biology and chemistry.With this broad preparation, you will engage with biochemistry and molecular biology at a very high level, allowing you to integrate your knowledge in molecular and cellular biology, and to think and address issues occurring at the forefront of the biochemical/biomedical sciences.Majors are also encouraged to participate in academic-year and/or summer research and majors usually have more than one research internship experience before graduation.Of the 15 graduates biochemistry has averaged each year, typically one-third goes to medical school and one-third to graduate school directly after graduation.The remaining one-third work in biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries, conduct research in a university lab before returning to school for higher degree training, or work in allied professions such as patent law, science education, health care consulting, and investment banking.Program InformationProgram

may select any BIOL-145 topic, such asBIOL-145AB,BIOL-145EX,BIOL-145GW, andBIOL-145MB.Other RequirementsSenior Symposium.All seniors must give an oral presentation on a biochemical topic in the Senior Symposium.Additional SpecificationsStudents who are interested in taking the biochemistry core courses (BIOCH-311andBIOCH-314) in their junior year are encouraged to complete at leastCHEM-150(orCHEM-160),CHEM-231, andBIOL-145(orBIOL-160) andBIOL-200during the first year.A student coming to the College with advanced credits from IB or A-level course work or Advanced Placement examinations, in accordance with the number of advanced credits received, should consult with the program chair or other members of the Biochemistry Program Committee to determine the appropriate placement for introductory courses in both biology and chemistry.The committee further recommendsCHEM-325to students planning graduate work in biochemistry.Independent study 295 or 395 does not count towards the minimum of 49 required credits.Students who declare a biochemistry major automatically fulfill the College's "outside the major" requirement.CoursesCourse OfferingsBIOCH-295  Independent StudyFall and Spring.Credits: 1 - 4In this class, students will acquire hands-on and/or applied experience in diverse aspects of the research process in any field of Biochemistry under the direction and supervision of a faculty advisor.Typically, these projects are related to the research program of the advisor.Student experiences often include: familiarizing themselves with a research topic, generating interesting questions, designing experiments, acquiring technical and instrumentation skills, collecting and analyzing data, writing and/or presenting their results.Faculty in the Biochemistry program accept research students through research applications within their home departments.To inquire about enrollment, students should therefore fill out the application forms available through the Departments of Chemistry and Biological Sciences.The application is generally available each semester with a deadline immediately following the advising period, and faculty meet before the end of the semester to place students in labs for the following semester.Enrollment into a research opportunity depends on lab capacity, so often not all applications are able to be fulfilled.A single credit requires an average of 3 hours of work per week.(Note: Some faculty may require a set weekly meeting time for a portion of this class.)The departmentInstructor permission required.Notes: Students conducting an independent lab research project for credit in a department, program, or lab covered by the College's chemical hygiene plan must participate in a safety training session before beginning research.BIOCH-311  Protein Biochemistry and Cellular MetabolismFall.Credits: 4This course is a rigorous introduction to the study of protein molecules and their role as catalysts in the cell.Topics include general principles of protein folding, protein structure-function correlation, enzyme kinetics and mechanism, carbohydrate and lipid biochemistry, and metabolic pathways (catabolic and anabolic) and their interaction and cross-regulation.Biological transformation of energy is considered in light of the principles of thermodynamics.Applies to requirement(s):

preparation, proper use of instrumentation, SDS-PAGE gel analysis, enzyme activity assays, protein structure viewing, experimental design and utilizing computers to analyze and present data.Laboratory safety is also emphasized.Applies to requirement(s): Meets No Distribution RequirementC.GravelCoreq:BIOCH-311students must co-enroll in this lab course.CHEM-312/BIOCH-312students may co-enroll.BIOCH-330  Topics in Biochemistry and Molecular BiologyThis course each year examines a number of important and exciting topics in biochemistry, molecular biology, and other related fields of biology.The intellectual and research development that formulated these fundamental concepts is traced through extensive readings of the primary literature.Discussions emphasize the critical evaluation of experimental techniques, data analysis, and interpretation.This is a seminar-style course in which students will bear responsibility for the synthesis and presentation of assigned papers; substantial student participation in the form of oral presentation is expected.BIOCH-330RN  Topics in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: 'The RNA World: The Origin of Life to Modern Cells'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4RNA is believed by many to have been the first macromolecule to evolve.In a hypothesized "RNA world," RNA would have simultaneously served the roles of carrying genetic information and catalyzing chemical reactions within early cells.The past three decades have been a renaissance for RNA biology, as researchers have uncovered the critical role RNA plays in eukaryotic and bacterial gene regulation and defense, as well as the potential for RNAs to perform catalysis.This seminar will introduce students to modern approaches to study the structure and function of RNA and will explore the chemical and biological roles RNA plays in modern cells as well as its role in the origin of life.Crosslisted as:CHEM-330RNApplies to requirement(s): Math
