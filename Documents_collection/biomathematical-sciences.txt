Faculty Leadership Development ProgramsWomen's Studies Research CenterBiomathematical Sciences ProgramThe goal of this program is to create educational structures that help Five College students become scientifically multilingual in fields of life and quantitative sciences by providing the means for each student to trace their own intentional pathway across the disciplines.BreadcrumbHomeAcademicsThe daunting complexities of biological phenomena from neurological development to ecosystem carbon fluxes require development of new modeling and analytic approaches.Sorting through potential mechanisms and patterns to develop testable hypotheses requires collaboration between life science investigators and mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists.Cutting edge life science research increasingly involves such collaborations, but researchers are too often stymied by the different languages of their disciplines.The goal of this program is to create educational structures that help Five College students become scientifically multilingual in fields of life and quantitative sciences by providing the means for each student to trace their own intentional pathway across the disciplines.The Five College Certificate in Biomathematical Sciences is currently available to students at Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges, and courses in the program are available to all students enrolled at one of the five campuses through the Five College Course Interchange.On This PageEngaged AlumniLearn how Hampshire College alum Nicole DelRosso engaged with Biomathematical Sciences while a student at the Five Colleges!Read more about Nicole hereDorothy Wrinch: The First Biomathematician in the ValleyThe Four College Biomathematics Program, begun in 2011, allows the colleges of the Pioneer Valley to work together across many scientific disciplines.This, however, is not the first biomathematics collaboration in the college consortium.The first experiment with intercollege cooperation in any field began 70 years earlier, with the appointment of Dorothy Wrinch in 1941 to teach courses on molecular biology at Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Smith colleges.In her words, the effort was “the first of its kind to be given in any center of higher education.”Learn more about Dorothy hereCertificate RequirementsThe Five College Certificate in Biomathematical Sciences is currently available to students enrolled at Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges.A minimum of six courses and a research experience are required.In addition to an introductory and capstone biomathematical sciences courses, students are expected to take courses complementing their major.Students with majors in the quantitative sciences (mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, and physics) are expected to take courses in the life sciences (biology, neuroscience, biochemistry, chemistry, etc.)and students with majors in the life sciences are expected to take courses in the quantitative sciences for the certificate.A biomathematical science research experience is also an essential component of the certificate, to provide an experience outside the classroom.In summary, to qualify for the Five College Certificate in Biomathematical Sciences, students must complete the following:One gateway course: an entry level biomath course to introduce current research questions and foundational skills4 courses in the life sciences if you are majoring in a quantitative science, or 4 courses in the quantitative sciences if you are majoring in a life scienceA capstone course in biomathematical or biostatistical methods or an honors thesis in a biomathematical sciences topicA research experience of one summer (or equivalent) with a team of life and mathematical science mentorsThe gateway course should contain some basic programming skills and examples in biology.Courses that students have used include Frontiers in Biomathematics (Smith, IDP 170), Modeling in the Sciences (Smith, MTH 205), and Mathematical Modeling (Amherst, Math 140).At least 2 of the 4 courses that complement the major should be upper level courses.Hybrid courses, e.g., computational biology, bioinformatics, biostatistics, can count toward either life sciences or quantitative sciences.To explore the certificate program, please contact your campus certificate advisor or the current program director.Biomathematical Sciences Certificate Completion
