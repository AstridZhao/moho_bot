Our instructional program offers opportunities for you to acquire lifetime sport and movement skills that will enhance your overall quality of life, both now and in the future. Physical Education Faculty    Athletics           Program Overview    Ever since Mount Holyoke’s earliest days, a commitment to physical education has been part of the College’s heart and soul. That tradition continues today with a range of course offerings—from aquatics, racket sports, fitness, and dance, to martial arts, equestrianism, and the academic study of women in sport. We aim to develop an awareness and an intelligent understanding of the need for healthy physical activity. Instructional programs are designed to offer opportunities for you to acquire lifetime sports and movement skills that will enhance quality of life now and in the future. Four physical education units are required of all students, except transfer students and Frances Perkins Scholars who are required to complete two physical education units. If you do not feel safe in deep water you are encouraged to take a swimming course. Most physical education courses meet two hours a week for one semester, for two physical education units. Some courses, however, meet for half a semester, for one physical education unit. We do not offer a physical education major, but you may propose an 18-credit educational studies minor with a concentration in sport pedagogy and coaching. Within physical education, one class is offered for academic credit: PHYED-275 Introduction to Sport Pedagogy (4 academic credits). See the end of the physical education listings for this course.
