It lives on in the influence it exerted on countless later writers and thinkers and, of course, in Latin works that modern audiences continue to find relevant.      Classics and Italian Faculty           Program Overview    Among the most familiar names in Latin literature are those from its apex in the first century BCE and first century CE. Authors such as Cicero, Caesar, Catullus, Vergil, Horace, Livy, Ovid, and Tacitus mastered the genres of epic, lyric, and elegiac poetry, satire, oratory, and historiography.  We offer courses in Latin at all levels, with those at the intermediate and advanced levels focusing on many of the authors mentioned above. You will also find a wide array of courses (in English) approaching the culture and history of Roman antiquity from a variety of perspectives.  While the study of Latin is a foundation stone of the discipline of classics, the Latin major or minor is also excellent preparation for advanced study in English, religion, philosophy, and history. There are also many opportunities for teaching Latin at the middle and high school levels      Program Information  Program Type    Major  Minor    Outcome  Bachelor of Arts  Department    Department of Classics and Italian             Community Voices  Spotlight on Latin students and alums       Go to the previous slide.

Credits: 4   The career of the Roman orator and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero spanned the last generation of the Roman Republic, a period of political instability and civil war. As the leading orator of his day, Cicero often used his rhetorical skills to thwart those who he believed were bent on the destruction of the Roman Republic. In this course, we will examine the role of public oratory in the political process in this period with a close reading of Cicero's speeches and letters concerning one of his political enemies (Catiline, Clodius, or Mark Antony).

Their narratives thus are highly rhetorical, combining myth, memory, and history to reconstruct the past. Close reading of selections from Livy's Ab Urbe Condita and/or Sallust's monographs--the Bellum Catilinae and Bellum Jugurthinum --will lead to discussions about how Romans viewed their past and how they wrote about it.
