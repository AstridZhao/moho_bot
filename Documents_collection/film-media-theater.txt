FMT-330  Advanced Courses in History and Theory      FMT-330AD  Advanced Courses in History and Theory: 'Adaptation: A Study in Form'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   The Oxford English Dictionary defines "adaptation" as "the bringing of two things together so as to effect a change in the nature of the objects." Rather than studying adaptation as a project that attempts to reproduce an original work in another medium, our course considers the complex relationship between narratives and their retellings and revisions. In particular, we will focus on how such retellings permanently alter their so-called "source" material and how each incarnation of a given narrative offers us insight into and commentary upon a particular historical moment and its unique political and ideological challenges. We will also consider the ways in which literary and visual representations differ in their communicative and affective mechanisms, and challenge where we draw the line between "art," "history," and "entertainment.

The oral theater traditions of Africa are an example of the innate human quest to perform and will eventually be the basis for understanding some of the innovations made in African literary theater. We shall also focus on writings by African writers and writers of African descent who deal with the post-colonial conditions of Black Africa and the African Diaspora. This class is designed to serve as a window into the continent of Africa: its people, its ideas, triumphs, struggles, and the complex histories emerging from its vastness and diversity.

FMT-330AV  Advanced Courses in History and Theory: 'Artists vs. Audiences'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   Usually, an artist produces a work, and then an audience experiences that work. However, sometimes audiences influence what a work means and even how an ongoing story unfolds. This course focuses on works of popular, serialized art in which the possibilities for artist/audience interaction are great, and so is the potential for conflict. We look at serial novels, film series, television shows, and new media (such as TikTok), among others. What are the rights of artists to control their works? What rights do audiences have to alter or create new works based on an existing work? What should we do when these rights conflict? What makes a "bad fan" bad? When do audiences become artists?

Credits: 4   Film critics Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott contend that "movies may be male dominated, but images of men are surprisingly narrow." This course both explores various constructs of postmodern American masculinity as they are portrayed and disseminated through contemporary film, and seeks to understand some of what is at stake (culturally, ideologically, economically) in perpetuating certain cinematic archetypes. Of particular relevance to our investigation are the ways in which film yokes masculinity to race, gender, and class. Films include Full Metal Jacket, No Country for Old Men, The Big Lebowski, Boyz in the Hood, Paris is Burning, Fight Club, and Moonlight.

Credits: 4   The course considers the connections between media as channels for communication and expression, on the one hand, and mediums as those who claim to have contact with the dead, on the other. Students will study the ways communication and performance media, from Shakespearian theater, to films and photographs of deceased loved ones, to legacy accounts on Facebook, have served as conduits of the dead and even spawned occult practices. The course will address: how do theater, film, and other media bridge us to what has been lost and animate our connections to those who have died? How do ghostly media ask us to confront a past that has been buried? Applies to requirement(s): Humanities H.

Credits: 4   This course investigates the ways media have mediated cultural perceptions of "moms" and "motherhood," from the maternal melodramas of Hollywood Cinema to ultrasound images used to justify government policies regulating women's health decisions. Along the way we consider how reality TV has represented moms as figures of excess, nurture, irresponsibility, and domesticity; how the horror genre probes the uncanny, creepy, and violent aspects of motherhood; motherhood as refracted through social media influencer culture; and counter-hegemonic representations of trans parenthood. We discuss the entanglements between representation, regulation, and resistance around these mediations of mothers. Applies to requirement(s): Humanities H.

Combining critical frames from Media Studies and Sexuality Studies, this seminar investigates what happens when media and sexuality intersect. We will ask how media and technology bolster new forms of sexual expression, communication, and embodiment. And, at the same time, we will examine how emerging technologies enable new modes of social regulation and surveillance. Throughout, we will foreground queer, trans, and feminist perspectives on media histories and digital futures.

Students learn about the history of fascism and anti-fascism in general, Spain's pivotal role in the battle between the two opposing ideologies, the stylistic traits adopted by each in cinema, and how films themselves can wage "reel" revolution. Struggles against capitalism, officially dictated national(ist) histories and cis-hetero-normativity, as well as stances in favor of organized anarchism, are also central to anti-fascist art and politics. The course concludes with reflections on anti-fascism in the Americas, particularly in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States.

"Shakespeare" comes first, of course, both historically and as the source/inspiration for the films. Yet each film has its own existence, to be understood not just as an "adaptation," but also as the product of linked artistic, technical, and economic choices. Considering Shakespeare's plays as pre-texts (rather than pre-scriptions), we will look at early and recent films, both those that follow closely conventionalized conceptualizations of "Shakespeare," and those that tend to erase or emend their Shakespearean sources. Crosslisted as: ENGL-312SF Applies to requirement(s): Humanities H. Holder Restrictions: This course is open to juniors and seniors Prereq: 8 credits from English beyond the 100 level, including ENGL-211 . FMT-330SP  Advanced Courses in History and Theory: 'Shakespeare in Performance'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   To what purpose(s) have Shakespeare's plays been staged, and how has staging practice changed and developed? Our focus will be broad, covering such matters as acting, directing, set and costume design, and criticism and dramaturgy. Units will include period and modern dress productions, realistic staging and the reaction against it, changing acting styles, "historically accurate" productions, global and decolonized Shakespeare, topical and political productions, and gender and race in casting. Several key plays will form the core, including A Midsummer Night's Dream and Macbeth. Includes a research project of the student's devising.

FMT-330SV  Advanced Courses in History and Theory: 'Media and Surveillance'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   With corporations using our data to anticipate our desires and counterterrorism units tapping into our communications, we are increasingly embedded in a surveillance society. This course considers practices of surveillance across media platforms, from smartphones, fitness trackers, and baby monitors to the biometric technologies that determine who may cross borders. We will explore how different governments, corporations, and individuals use new media to surveil others, as well as the ways racism and transphobia are inscribed in surveillance practices. We will also discuss and try out protective measures and various subversive practices of "sousveillance. Applies to requirement(s): Humanities H.

Credits: 4   This course analyzes the fight against fascism through the lens of Spanish cinema. Students learn about the history of fascism and anti-fascism in general, Spain's pivotal role in the battle between the two opposing ideologies, the stylistic traits adopted by each in cinema, and how films themselves can wage "reel" revolution. Struggles against capitalism, officially dictated national(ist) histories and cis-hetero-normativity, as well as stances in favor of organized anarchism, are also central to anti-fascist art and politics. The course concludes with reflections on anti-fascism in the Americas, particularly in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States.
