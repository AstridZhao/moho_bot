Psychology and Education Faculty           Program Overview    The multidisciplinary nature of the minor offers varied perspectives on contexts and historical moments that shape and define knowledge, behavior, structures, and policies both in and out of classrooms. If you are planning to minor in educational studies, you must consult with a member of the program committee to discuss an area of interest and design a plan of study. A brief proposal and plan of study outlining the focus of the minor and the courses making up the minor must be approved by the program chair. The culminating experience of the minor is a 2-credit Educational Studies course requiring students to analyze and synthesize key ideas that have emerged from their focused study. You will work with a faculty advisor as they write and present a capstone paper or project.  Please note: this minor in educational studies does not lead to teacher licensure.
