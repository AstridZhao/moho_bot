Sociology asks fundamental questions about individuals, institutions, and global processes. It connects biography with history in the sociological imagination, enabling us to analyze complex social relationships in a new way.      Sociology and Anthropology Faculty           Program Overview    A fundamentally interdisciplinary perspective, sociology asks questions that intersect with those in anthropology, art, economics, gender studies, history, literature, media studies, politics, studies of postcoloniality and racial and ethnic studies. The field employs a wide range of systematic research methods including archival research, comparative-historical research, ethnography, interviewing and survey research, statistical analysis and data visualization.  Sociology majors are critical thinkers who are equipped to create social innovation and meaningful social change.  Can I do an independent study in Sociology?  You may request to enroll in independent study after your freshman year. Independent studies can accommodate a range of research projects and may become an honors thesis. Small grants are available to help support the costs of these projects for sophomores, juniors and seniors who are majoring in Sociology or Anthropology.

Credits: 4   COVID-19 has upended schooling in the United States. Assumptions about physical co-presence, standardized testing, the rights of students, and the responsibilities of schools have all been transformed at warp speed. The pandemic also exposed durable fault lines in American education and society. This course provides an opportunity to evaluate our present moment using classical and contemporary sociological perspectives on mass schooling. It highlights issues facing the future of education, the role of schooling in struggles for economic and racial justice, and how the aspirations of individuals and families interact with state institutions to shape the American social and economic order.

Credits: 4   How do family and kinship shape our social lives? In turn, how are family and kinship shaped by social and historical contexts? We all come to this course with individual experiences of family, kinship, and sexuality, but this course will ask you to critically engage with these concepts from a sociological perspective. In this course we will both define and use an intersectional lens to understand how class, race-ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and citizenship mutually shape our individual and collective experiences of family and kinship. We will consider family as a site for reproducing inequality and violence, but also as a site for resistance, revolution, and home. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences S. Leonard Prereq: SOCI-123 .  SOCI-216MK  Special Topics in Sociology: 'Marketing and Society'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   Marketing penetrates every domain of society.

This course offers students insight on the fundamentals of marketing through a critical lens. Readings and assignments will give students an understanding of the theories and concepts that underlie marketing, along with its practical elements. We will be especially attentive to the ways that marketing influences social inequality. An ongoing question that we will explore over the term is what is the potential for, and what are the limits of, marketing as a force for reducing gender, class, racial, and other forms of inequality. Among assignments will be exercises where students critically examine marketing campaigns, such as inclusive beauty campaigns, and a project where students develop a marketing campaign that is attentive to social purpose. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences P.

Credits: 4   This course will focus on the relations between gender, politics, and social change to explore the gendered character of citizenship, political participation, and mobilization. We'll start by considering what makes a social movement, who mobilizes, and what resistance has, does, and can look like in practice. Students will engage with historical and contemporary cases of feminist and women's social movements to explore how gender constructs both formal political participation and activism. We will explore how feminist and women's movements have contributed to alternative practices of politics and visions of social change and wellbeing. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences S. Leonard Prereq: SOCI-123 .  SOCI-216PT  Special Topics in Sociology: 'Political Sociology'  Spring. Credits: 4   This course focuses on political processes and power -- in particular, which groups have the ability to implement their political, social, and economic agendas, which ones do not, and why. We will explore the means by which certain groups affect political outcomes that shape society and social- political reality. In particular, we will concentrate on the interrelationship between the state, the market, and civil society, and investigate how this intersection has informed the politics of our time. By the end of this course, students are expected to have achieved an understanding of the major theoretical perspectives and debates in political sociology, and a sense of the historical and contemporary organizations, parties, classes, and other groups that influence social change. We will focus mostly on western democracies, especially the U.S., but other countries and political arrangements will also be included. Globalization as an on-going social, political, and economic system will be discussed throughout the semester. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences K. Tucker Prereq: 4 credits in sociology.  SOCI-216QD  Special Topics in Sociology: 'Qualitative Research and Data Analysis'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   This course introduces students to qualitative research methods.

We will focus on methods such as in-depth interviews, focus groups, and close observations. This course will provide students with the skills and knowledge to pursue qualitative data analysis in future projects such as for an independent study, senior thesis, or internship. In addition, since cases will focus on consumer research, this class is also well-suited for students who want to learn qualitative research techniques that are used in marketing. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences The department  SOCI-216TX  Special Topics in Sociology: 'Text as Data I: From Qualitative to Quantitative Text Analysis'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   Characterizing, categorizing, and counting text documents is at the heart of research and knowledge development in the social sciences and humanities. New digital technologies have introduced new methods for analyzing text documents on a massive scale. These computational approaches have also provoked important debates about the role of meaning, context, and reproducibility in social science research. This course considers the affordances of new digital methods for text analysis in relation to established practices of qualitative coding. Students will explore this new frontier in a hands-on manner using Python to count and compare relevant features of text documents in large data sets. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences B.

Credits: 4   This is a course on the social construction of social problems. It devotes almost exclusive attention to how a 'problem' becomes a social problem; examining how atypical cases become regarded as typical; how definitions are expanded to inflate statistics; and how claim makers and advocacy groups manipulate the media to market social problems and solutions to the public. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences C. Sever Prereq: SOCI-123 .  SOCI-239  How Capitalism Works: Social Class, Power, and Ideology  Fall. Credits: 4   The Occupy movement protests and recent popular uprisings across developing countries draw attention to rising global economic inequality. This course asks, "How does capitalism produce and reproduce economic inequality both within and across nations?" Drawing on theoretical and empirical research, we will examine class relations as a way to explain the unequal distribution of wealth and power. We will also discuss the role of the state and ideology in perpetuating the gap between the rich and poor. Students will learn the social dynamics underlying a range of contemporary issues in advanced and developing economies, ranging from labor exploitation to unemployment and financial crises.

Credits: 4   This course investigates economic development and globalization through a sociological lens. What is development? Why and how has the idea of development changed over time? Which development policies has this promoted, and with what consequences on people's lives in developing countries? Based on case studies across Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, the course examines economic, political, and institutional factors that inform global development processes from post-WWII to the present. As we discuss challenges to the neoliberal development paradigm, students will gain a critical perspective on contemporary issues such as environmental damage, global inequality, and poverty.

SOCI-316FN  Special Topics in Sociology: 'Finance, Globalization, and Inequality'  Spring. Credits: 4   We live in a financialized world dominated by financial actors, markets and institutions. From the Occupy Wall Street movement to ongoing debates about the power of big banks, finance has been seen as the culprit for the 2008 financial crisis, U.S. income and wealth inequality, and global instability. But what explains the rise of finance and how has finance gone global? How does global finance contribute to inequality within and across nations? We will tackle these questions by covering some of the recent sociological research on finance and financial globalization. Students will examine the political and institutional roots of financialization and its consequences in advanced and developing economies. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences A.

Credits: 4   Inequality in the United States is at levels not seen since the 1920s, yet we know relatively little about those at the top who've accumulated enormous wealth and power. This course is a critical study of American Elites. Who are they? How did they amass such staggering resources? How are these resources used in the political, economic, and social spheres to reproduce/enhance their privilege? We put contemporary American elites into historical perspective, interrogate their origins, and evaluate the networks and practices that distinguish them from everyone else. We also analyze the narratives used to justify their privilege and consider their potential for group solidarity and collective action Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive B.

Townsley Prereq: SOCI-123 .  SOCI-316PS  Special Topics in Sociology: 'Digital Media and the Public Sphere'  Fall. Credits: 4   How do different kinds of stories unfold in contemporary public spheres? How do we make sense of pressing matters of common concern as members of publics? This research seminar asks: what are the effects of a pervasive cultural distrust in social institutions, the widespread mediatization of everyday life, and the intercultural and intertextual nature of media texts themselves? Drawing from foundational texts about media, the role of intellectuals, and the public sphere, students will be asked to develop an empirical case study to explore these questions and test their ideas. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences E. Townsley Prereq: 8 credits in Sociology.  SOCI-316RM  Special Topics in Sociology: 'Consumer Culture: Race in the Marketplace'  Not Scheduled for This Year.

SOCI-316ST  Special Topics in Sociology: 'Storytelling Sociology: Data for the People'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   How can we communicate social science knowledge to the wider public? How can we interpret, and assess the quality of, social scientific sources? In this writing-intensive seminar, students will build data literacy and public writing skills to translate important social scientific findings to wider audiences. In a workshop-style model that maps the process of publication, students will create a long-form story that they may seek to publish in wider news outlets. Embedded within is a continuous exploration of social science communication ethics: what is the anticipated impact of publication on marginalized groups? What responsibility do writers carry of audience understandings? Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive C. Sever Prereq: 8 credits in the department.  SOCI-316SY  Special Topics in Sociology: 'The Business of Culture: Marketing & Selling Symbolic Goods'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   This course investigates the creative economy through a sociological lens. Through case studies of various creative industries, as well as examination of the creative sector as a whole, we will examine how the cultural economy influences, and is influenced by, social phenomena. We will explore issues such as how value is produced in the field of fashion modeling, how music and other creative industries drive urban economies, how local crafts enter global markets, and how norms and values influence the adoption of e-commerce in the market for fine art. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences P. Banks Restrictions: Course limited to sophomores, juniors and seniors  SOCI-316TX  Special Topics in Sociology: 'Text as Data II: Computational Text Analysis for the Social Sciences'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   How can the social sciences benefit from remarkable advances in hardware and software that have unlocked new approaches to using text-as-data? This course interrogates the use of text-as-data from both social scientific and computational perspectives. Students will consider how meaning and context are theorized and how scale is achieved in the analysis of text by social scientists and computational experts. This new frontier will be explored in a hands-on manner; by the end of the course, students will deploy machine learning models to gain insights from large bodies of text such that we may evaluate the utility of these approaches in our quest for insight into the social world.

Credits: 4   What makes violences "intimate"? And how are the most private experiences of violence also collective ones? This course examines how seemingly private violences - such as intimate partner violence - come to be defined as public problems. Students will analyze how collective violences are intimately experienced and how intimate violences are collective issues. In our sociological examination of violence, we will trace the connections between the intimate and the collective, the historical and the present, the interpersonal and the structural to answer our initial questions of how to define violence, intimacy, and intimate violences. We will conclude by examining responses and solutions that have been enacted to prevent abuse and will imagine futures without violence.
