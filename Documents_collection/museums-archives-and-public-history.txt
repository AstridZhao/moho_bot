Public HistoryUndergraduateThe Nexus in Museums, Archives, and Public History allows you to explore careers which draw specifically on capacities developed in the study of the humanities.These fields require multiple literacies: professionals must be fluent in understanding, analyzing, and communicating about visual artifacts, material culture/objects, historical landscapes, and digital sources.Nexus Track ChairsProgram OverviewAdditionally, you will take four credits of pre- and post-internship courses that facilitate thoughtful engagement with the internship opportunity.While the Nexus certificate requires one internship, a concentration in museums, archives, and public history depends upon internships as a component of professional training, so students undertaking the Nexus should explore a succession of internships at Mount Holyoke and elsewhere in a way that will allow them to develop a significant set of skills.Program InformationProgram TypeNEXUSDepartmentThe Nexus
