The certificate furnishes an excellent foundation on which to build a professional career, graduate work or research. Its requirements provide a strong grounding while each student works closely with a faculty advisor to design an individualized course of study.  I n pursuing the certificate, you will:  Learn the depth and breadth of Indigenous methodologies and their applications to the most pressing issues of today  Critically approach the field through engagement with Native and Indigenous intellectual traditions, histories and cultures  Undertake meaningful research in archives, on the land and with communities  Work with leading scholars across multiple fields, as well as with visiting tribal scholars  Understand the unique sovereign status of Native and Indigenous peoples, the complexity of Indigenous legal and political systems and the many facets of U.S. and international law and policy  The NAIS certificate is available to students at Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Please note that the certificate cannot be completed online.  Certificate Requirements      No application is necessary prior to beginning the certificate, but students can fill out the Interest Form to participate in the Program. Your campus advisor can help you design an interdisciplinary program of study. No formal enrollment is necessary to pursue your study. To receive the Certificate, you must demonstrate that you have fulfilled the requirements prior to graduation.  At least seven courses are required for completion of the Five College Certificate in Native American and Indigneous Studies: a foundation course plus six additional courses, with no more than three of the seven courses from a single discipline (such as Anthropology or Literature). Requirements are as follows:  One foundation course : Offered at various levels, foundation courses provide an opportunity to hear Native perspectives and are taught from a philosophical perspective that reflects Native Studies theories, pedagogies and methodologies. They foster: 1) respect for Native intellectual perspectives during the course of their ongoing histories; 2) a grounding in perspectives on life derived from the diversity of philosophies found in contemporary Native communities; and 3) an understanding of colonialism and its impacts on the contested sovereignties and associated struggles of Native communities. Consult with your NAIS advisor or the Program Chair to identify the appropriate foundations course.  Six additional courses : Students must complete at least six additional courses, selected in consultation with your campus advisor. These may include courses from study abroad.  Grades : Students must receive a grade of B or higher in all seven courses to receive a Certificate.  Students are encouraged to use the Certificate Completion Form (below) to consult with their certificate advisor, plan for both which courses to take and for completing all certificate requirements. Students are expected to finalize this form with their certificate advisor and attach a copy of their unofficial transcript during the final semester of their senior year: no later than November 1 for fall/January graduates, and April 1 for spring/May graduates.
