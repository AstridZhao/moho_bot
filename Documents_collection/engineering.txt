provides a path from the traditional disciplines of the liberal arts to a career in engineering.Engineers are trained to solve a diverse set of problems, and a student may major in the field of science or mathematics most closely allied to the engineering subfield in which the student is interested.Combining a science or mathematics major with some additional course work and summer internships in engineering is excellent preparation for future graduate work in engineering or employment in engineering-related fields.Nexus Track ChairsThe Engineering CommitteeProgram OverviewWhile the Engineering Nexus explicitly is not an engineering degree or accreditation, it is intended as a route into the field of engineering.The experiential portion of the Nexus involves completing a summer internship in the field of engineering.This may be participating in a formal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in an academic laboratory, a summer internship with an engineering firm, working abroad for the summer in an engineering laboratory, or other options.Program InformationProgram TypeNEXUSDepartmentThe Nexus ProgramCourses and RequirementsNexus

responsibilities that exercise ability to think analytically and creatively, and contribute meaningfully to the organization’s stated mission and complements the student's area of focusAdditional SpecificationsGiven the diversity of the engineering field, a wide range of courses can count toward the Nexus.Note that a random selection from the list of Nexus in Engineering courses provided will not be automatically approved by an Engineering Nexus advisor.It is critical for students to understand what subfields of engineering they wish to pursue and how they enhance their existing majors.Nexus students will develop a brief proposal outlining their specific area of focus including a course outline.Students will schedule an advising meeting with a track chair to get approval and complete aPlan of Study formto be returned to the Nexus Program office.The sequence of a Nexus is part of what makes it unique:In preparation for the summer internship or research, students complete courses chosen in consultation with the track chair.If seeking funding through LYNK UAF, students will additionally complete orientation and advising, and online training.COLL-211is taken after the internship or research project and culminates in a presentation at LEAP Symposium.CoursesCourses Counting toward the NexusStudents craft their selection of courses in consultation with a Nexus in Engineering advisor.These courses are examples of courses that have been used in the past for a particular program.See theNexus in Engineering websitefor examples of how some of these courses may fit together with majors and subfields of engineering.Course ListCodeTitleCreditsChemistryCHEM-328From Lilliput to Brobdingnag: Bridging the Scales Between Science and Engineering4College(Interdeptmnt)
