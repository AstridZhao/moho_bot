Search                      Academics    Find Your Program   Greek       Greek  Undergraduate   Ancient Greek is very much alive, not just in the medical and technical terms that pervade modern life, but in the numerous works that still speak to audiences today. Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Greek tragedies, Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War and, of course, the New Testament are just some of the names on Greek's list of "Greatest Hits." Classics and Italian Faculty           Program Overview    The great works, of course, can be read in translation, and we offer a wide array of courses approaching the culture and history of Greek antiquity through readings entirely in English. But juxtapose any two translations of a work in Ancient Greek and you will quickly realize how much the translator stands between you and the original. For this reason, our language program is designed to allow students to read Homer's Iliad in Greek as soon as possible—and to help them learn to use the tools needed for learning Greek on their own. Beyond the first year, we offer a range of courses at all levels. The Greek major (or minor) complements well the study of philosophy, religion, politics, English, ancient art history, and archaeology, and in some cases Greek is necessary for advanced study in these areas. It is also excellent preparation for law school, while some of our majors have completed their pre-med course work and gone on to medical school. Most important, the study of Greek (Latin, too) provides a strong foundation in the liberal arts, one that challenges students to think deeply about difficult questions and to value the power of language.
