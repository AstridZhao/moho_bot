The interdisciplinary minor in Entrepreneurship, Organizations, and Society aims to prepare you for the economic realities and social challenges of today’s world. The minor can be combined with any major. The EOS Committee           Program Overview    Envisioning socially impactful action requires an understanding of problems from multiple perspectives, of difference along multiple axes, of the dynamics of organizations, and of individual and collective agency in social context. And advancing solutions demands creative thinking, resilience and risk-taking, collaboration with multiple stakeholders, and command of basic business practices. In EOS, you will learn to develop such understandings and competencies through engagement in four subject areas, applied learning experiences, and connections with practitioners in the field. The curriculum consists of four subject areas:  Entrepreneurship  Organizations and Power  Structures of Inequality  Financial Analysis  If you choose to minor in EOS, you will choose one approved course from each of the four areas, with one course at the 300 level. You are encouraged to integrate your course work with applied learning experiences and to interact with practitioners in their field. You should select a coherent set of courses and applied learning experiences that fit your specific interests and aspirations. You should seek advice from the member of the EOS committee who best matches your interest.

Credits: 4   This is a research seminar, designed to introduce students to classic and recent debates on the "history of capitalism" and to support original research on a broad array of topics related to the social and cultural history of economic life.

Topics include revolutions in agriculture, finance, commerce and manufacturing; the political economy of empire; the relationship between economic ideas, institutions and practice; and, the shaping of economic life by gender, class and race.

This course is relevant for students interested in motivation, whether for attainment (such as within in human resources, talent development, or management) or for learning (whether for students, teachers, or leaders). Because motivation is closely linked to learning and achievement, in addition to well-being and purpose, we will also consider these topics and more.

Area One: Entrepreneurship  Being an entrepreneur in today’s rapidly changing world requires the ability to apply critical, analytical and creative thinking to the global and local problems at hand, process large amounts of information from a range of knowledge areas, work in teams, assess financial resource requirements and feasibility, and communicate effectively.

Nonprofits, public institutions, and private businesses are all shaped by the particular histories, legal traditions, and relationships of power in different societies. To function well in organizations and leverage them to affect social needs, students need to understand the roles of different types of organizations, hierarchies of power, regulatory frameworks, social impacts, and ethical decision-making in organizational structures. These courses provide students with such understandings.
