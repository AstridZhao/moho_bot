you become an informed citizen who thinks critically about the important issues of our time.Politics FacultyProgram OverviewThe word “politics” in ordinary conversations may refer to struggles for power or justice among antagonistic individuals or groups; the types of regimes by which people are governed; the ties that bind subjects to rulers or citizens to states; the election of representatives, passage of laws, and voicing of public opinion in democratic societies; and international relations among different polities, whether they be empires, multinational federations, or nation-states.The phrase “international politics” encompasses the waging of war and conducting of peace, the pursuit of national interests in competition with other states, norms of interaction among sovereign states, projects of humanitarian intervention, and collective efforts to enhance state security, global order, and human rights.The study of such a complex subject has traditionally been divided into four overlapping fields:Political theorytackles the contested meanings of freedom, equality, power, justice, community, and individuality, as well as the clashing ideological perspectives by which different people make sense of political life.It also explores the ideas of influential political theorists from Plato to Thomas Hobbes to Hannah Arendt.American politicsstudies the history and current organization of political institutions at the national, state, and local level in the United States.It also examines conflicts in America over private rights and material interests; racial, class, and gender inequality; and public goods, including the good of American citizenship itself.Comparative politicscovers the spectrum of political histories, systems of government, public policies, political parties, and social movements across the world.It examines, for example, parliamentary systems, ethnic conflict, authoritarian regimes, immigration policy, and nationalist movements from Asia to Europe to the Americas to Africa and the Middle East.International politicsinvestigates U.S. foreign policy, international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and the International Criminal Court; the politics of population migrations; war, terrorism, and international security; and the political dilemmas sparked by economic globalization and such border-crossing problems as resource depletion and environmental decay.We offer courses within all four fields as well as courses that cross the lines between them.Program

debates since independence.Whether free trade, fair trade, or protectionism is best for America has been hotly debated for centuries.Decisions to trade or not to trade have also long been linked to other domestic and foreign policy issues including abolitionism and the Civil War, securing allies in the Cold War, building peaceful relations with China, and cementing U.S. global leadership.This course examines the shifting coalitions arguing over U.S. trade policy, the shifting goals they seek to accomplish via U.S. trade policy, and the international effects of U.S. trade.Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural PerspectivesC.MitchellPrereq:POLIT-116.POLIT-273  Public PolicySpring.Credits: 4Want to change your government for the better?This course is concerned with the practical business of how, focusing on the often invisible and underappreciated public servants who do the hard work of designing, implementing and enforcing the policies and programs on which modern societies depend.Their work is often nonideological, yet modern democracies have long harbored suspicions of the power of unelected bureaucrats.Students in this course will study these debates over the organization and functions of modern state administration, familiarize themselves with policymaking processes, and engage in designing practical solutions to some of the most pressing social issues of the present.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesR.DarrowPOLIT-277  Dislocation: Class and Politics in the U.S.Spring.Credits: 4Dislocation from work and home has been a common experience of the working class in the United States since World War II.Whether caused by factors such as the gentrification of urban neighborhoods and rural towns, deindustrialization, urban renewal, automation, or the precarity of low-wage employment, the working class experience of dislocation continues today.This course will examine the decision making behind the policies and practices that have dislocated many working class Americans, as well as how these people have adjusted, accommodated, resisted, and sometimes fought dislocation from their jobs and homes.In this course, class is viewed as a social position shaped by power relations.While race and gender will be taken into account, our main focus will be understanding and explaining the common experience of the working class majority in the U.S.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesOther Attribute(s): Writing-IntensiveP.SmithPrereq:POLIT-104orPOLIT-252, or 8 credits in Politics.POLIT-278  U.S. ElectionsNot Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4Elections are at the core of both the vitality and fragility of American democracy.Free and responsive government is hard to imagine without elections, yet U.S. elections suffer from relatively low turnout, increasing polarization, invisible money, racial and gender inequality, partisan gerrymandering, and new forms of voter disenfranchisement.This course offers students an overview of American elections by placing the November elections in historical and comparative perspective and following their development in real time.Students will also gain on-the-ground experience working in the local community as voter registrants and get-out-the-vote activists in the run-up to the November elections.By then end of the semester, students will have

violations.States have a myriad of options at their disposal, ranging from granting blanket amnesties to hosting complex trials and truth commissions.In making these decisions, new leaders face pressures from former authoritarian actors, victims' groups, and international organizations.This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses, and the political, legal, economic, and moral ramifications of each choice.Most importantly, it asks--does transitional justice work?Applies to

refugees.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesK.KhoryRestrictions: This course is open to juniors and seniorsPrereq: 8 Credits from PoliticsPOLIT-372  Earthborn DemocracyFall.Credits: 4The relationship between ecology and democracy has a complex history and an uncertain future.Ecological crises threaten all forms of life on earth, and democracy too is an endangered species, as popular discontent, elite malfeasance, and unresponsive institutions herald democratic crisis if not collapse.If our present political concepts and institutions are inadequate for meeting the challenges of living in right relation with the more-than-human world, these inadequacies are themselves symptoms of a failing political-culturalstoryand a lack of concrete practices of ecological renewal.Course readings will excavate political practices and stories illustrating the interdependence necessary to inspire and orient the work of ecological renewal.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesOther

been?Since the election of Donald Trump, observers have increasingly begun to question basic assumptions about the apparent stability of the American constitutional regime.Yet critical observers, activists, and political movements across the past two centuries have persistently called attention to the deficits of U.S. democracy and sought to rectify them.Is America presently at risk of "democratic backsliding"?Or will U.S. democracy prove resilient?This course puts the current distemper of U.S. democracy in historical perspective by examining the complex and contradictory patterns of democratic development from the Founding to the present.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveA.HiltonPrereq: 8 credits in the

Politics: 'Law and Inequality'Spring.Credits: 4The gap between the rich and the poor in the United States today is as wide as it was during the Great Depression.Some scholars and lawmakers have called our era the "Second Gilded Age," a reference that evokes images of robber barons and monopolists, the "billionaire class" of yesteryear.This seminar poses the question: what does law have to do with it?Together, we will explore all the ways that "law," "politics," and economics" are messily entwined, and how those entanglements explain who has wealth, who gets healthcare, who goes to jail, and who decides climate change policy.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveJ.WuestPrereq: 8 credits in the department andPOLIT-104.POLIT-387DE  Advanced Topics in Politics: 'Democratic Desire'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4If democracies trace their origins back to insurrections -- whether, to name three, the American, French, or Haitian -- how do we make sense of the near-universal condemnation of January 6th insurrections or of those participating in uprisings in Ferguson, Baltimore, Portland, Seattle, Athens or Madrid over the last decade as threats to democracy?This paradox points to an underdeveloped concept of desire across democratic theory that would explain the basis for the people to rule themselves.This course will explore democratic desire as both the desire not to be ruled by others and the desire for collective self-rule.Beginning with feminists writing about erotic power such as Audre Lorde and the varied practices of so-called "pleasure activists," we will understand the role of desire in politics, how it can be tapped into, why it can be so unruly, and why it is repressed.Tracing desire's anarchic element, our readings will examine "wild democracy" and the polymorphism of desire, as pathways for cultivating a healthy desire for exercising power and cooperating with others through organizing and movement practices.Readings may include titles by Anne Norton, adrienne marie brown, Lama Rod Owens, Norman O.Brown, Bonnie Honig, and Saidiya Hartman.Applies to requirement(s):

Wars'Spring.Credits: 4In the late 1970s through the 1980s, a series of contentious debates erupted in American feminism over pornography, prostitution, sadomasochism, and other issues related to sex, power, pleasure, desire, erotic community, and violence.This was a time of prolific theorizing and bitter conflict known as the "feminist sex wars."This course tries to make sense of some common contemporary discourses on pornography, sexual representation, sexual conduct, and sexual ethics by exploring their sources in the feminist political and theoretical debates of the sex wars, as well as examining how feminist engagement with these issues was entangled in larger political, cultural, and philosophical contexts.We will also question how the feminist sex wars are remembered and theorized today and what kind of stories about the feminist sex wars are repeatedly told in different institutional contexts.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesOther Attribute(s):

Topics in Politics: 'Health and Inequality'Fall.Credits: 4This course is designed to provide students with both an in-depth study of the political and social determinants of health and with queer, feminist, and postcolonial theorizations of health and the body.We will question and theorize what "health" is as well as study how economic and social inequality distribute unequal life chances.We will examine how race, class, gender, sexuality, and citizenship combine to help some survive and even profit from disease and illness while others perish and experience shame, stigma, and financial insecurity.We will study how politicians, scientists, and public health officials have treated different communities and how various marginalized communities have fought back for improved life chances.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesOther Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-IntensiveK.HendersonPrereq: 8 credits in the department.POLIT-387PD  Advanced Topics in Politics: 'Other Political Dreams'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4This course examines dreams of other politics, trying to recognize what is distinctive in a diverse set of traditions beyond their resistance to liberal-democracy's entwinement with contemporary capitalism.Spanning anarchism, Afro-pessimism and Afro-futurism, and the #BlackLivesMatter movement, we will examine political actions and thought that do not identify themselves as democratic and even define themselves as anti-democratic in order to name politics they aspire towards.Special attention will be given the picture of collective belonging and action that emerges in these works along with the techniques of figuring these visions and of gathering community around them.Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural PerspectivesOther Attribute(s): Writing-IntensiveA.AslamPrereq: 8 credits in Politics.POLIT-387PE  Advanced Topics in Politics: 'The 1%'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4In recent years, scholarship on American politics has challenged the idea that our government has upheld and expanded basic democratic principles since the fall of Jim Crow.This scholarship notes a growing wealth gap since the 1970s and 1980s that has given rise to a "New Gilded Age."Along with this rising wealth gap, the United States has also endured rising incarceration rates, a shrinking middle class, an eroding public sphere, and charges that plutocracy -- or governance by the rich -- has overtaken American democracy.In this course we will explore, investigate, and challenge several arguments and assumptions at the heart of these critiques of contemporary US politics.Students will read and discuss cutting edge scholarship and journalism exploring the inequality debates, including inquiries into the complex interrelations of race, gender, and class.Applies to requirement(s): Social SciencesA.HiltonPrereq: 8 credits in Politics includingPOLIT-104.POLIT-391  Pivotal Political IdeasPOLIT-391RE  Pivotal Political Ideas: 'Reparations and the Politics of Repair'Not Scheduled for This Year.Credits: 4This course will examine arguments for reparations for slavery with an eye towards understanding what withholding and extending reparations have meant for American democracy and citizenship.We will contextualize arguments for reparations within a larger conversation about repairing democratic norms, institutions, and social conditions within recent democratic theory.Together we will investigate what historical and ongoing injustices and inequalities reparations are meant to repair, how reparations would address those harms, and how arguments for reparations have mobilized social activists on both sides of the question.Our readings will span history, legal studies, politics, literature and the arts and arguments for reparations to be paid by the American state down to institutions such as corporations, universities, and other jurisdictions.Applies to
