Politics Faculty           Program Overview    The word “politics” in ordinary conversations may refer to struggles for power or justice among antagonistic individuals or groups; the types of regimes by which people are governed; the ties that bind subjects to rulers or citizens to states; the election of representatives, passage of laws, and voicing of public opinion in democratic societies; and international relations among different polities, whether they be empires, multinational federations, or nation-states. The phrase “international politics” encompasses the waging of war and conducting of peace, the pursuit of national interests in competition with other states, norms of interaction among sovereign states, projects of humanitarian intervention, and collective efforts to enhance state security, global order, and human rights. The study of such a complex subject has traditionally been divided into four overlapping fields:  Political theory tackles the contested meanings of freedom, equality, power, justice, community, and individuality, as well as the clashing ideological perspectives by which different people make sense of political life. It also explores the ideas of influential political theorists from Plato to Thomas Hobbes to Hannah Arendt. American politics studies the history and current organization of political institutions at the national, state, and local level in the United States. It also examines conflicts in America over private rights and material interests; racial, class, and gender inequality; and public goods, including the good of American citizenship itself. Comparative politics covers the spectrum of political histories, systems of government, public policies, political parties, and social movements across the world. It examines, for example, parliamentary systems, ethnic conflict, authoritarian regimes, immigration policy, and nationalist movements from Asia to Europe to the Americas to Africa and the Middle East. International politics investigates U.S. foreign policy, international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and the International Criminal Court; the politics of population migrations; war, terrorism, and international security; and the political dilemmas sparked by economic globalization and such border-crossing problems as resource depletion and environmental decay. We offer courses within all four fields as well as courses that cross the lines between them.

Credits: 4   Popular narratives about American politics today are often horror stories or crime stories, set in a realm of dirty tricksters, snake-oil salesmen and swamp creatures. Does entering the political arena mean going over to the dark side? This course separates myths, caricatures and textbook idealizations from the more complicated realities about political operators and their machinations. Participants will study the dark arts of electoral manipulation, propaganda, influence-peddling, and other cynical and subterranean political stratagems, learning how these tricks are performed, with the aims of counteracting their influence and designing more democratic modes of governance. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences R. Darrow  POLIT-248GE  Topics in Politics: 'Sex, Gender, and American Law'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   How does the law police or protect sexuality? Why do activists and attorneys spar over theories of gender identity? How did abortion become the seeming center of American politics? This course examines sexual and gender oppression and liberation in the U.S. from the nineteenth century to the present. We will explore how sexual and gender minorities won civil rights struggles, how those rights have been rolled back, and how these political conflicts have transformed the meanings of liberty and equality. In this pursuit, we will consult court cases, social movement histories, police records, "gayborhood" maps, labor union contracts, and other means by which law shapes identity and desire.

POLIT-255  Gender and Power in Global Contexts      POLIT-255PA  Gender and Power in Global Contexts: 'The Politics of Abortion in the Americas'  Fall. Credits: 4   The Americas have been characterized by the strictness of their laws in the criminalization of abortion. In some countries abortion is criminalized even when the woman's life is at risk. What role have women's movements played in advancing abortion rights? What has mattered most for a movement's success, its internal characteristics or external forces? Has the way the movement framed its demands mattered? How has the political influence of the Catholic and Evangelical churches influenced policies in this area? We will answer these questions by exploring examples from across the region through primary and secondary sources. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives C. Fernandez Anderson  POLIT-267  The Politics of Finance and Financial Crises  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   The development and operation of stable and effective banks and financial markets has a tremendous impact on the economy and political stability of rich and poor countries alike. A stable financial system may be a necessity for economic growth and a financial crisis can wipe out decades of growth in weeks. This course will critically examine the debates around regulation of finance and management of financial crises in both the advanced capitalist states and emerging markets. It will examine specifically the Latin American debt crisis, the East Asian financial crisis, the 2007-2009 trans-Atlantic financial crisis, and the European debt crisis.

POLIT-270  American Foreign Policy  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   In this examination of American foreign policy since 1898, topics include the emergence of the United States as a global power, its role in World War I and II, its conduct and interests in the cold war, and its possible objectives in a post-cold war world. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between domestic interests and foreign policy, the role of nuclear weapons in determining policy, and the special difficulties in implementing a democratic foreign policy. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences The department Prereq: POLIT-116 . POLIT-272  Trade and American Foreign Policy  Fall. Credits: 4   Trade policy has been central to American political debates since independence. Whether free trade, fair trade, or protectionism is best for America has been hotly debated for centuries. Decisions to trade or not to trade have also long been linked to other domestic and foreign policy issues including abolitionism and the Civil War, securing allies in the Cold War, building peaceful relations with China, and cementing U.S. global leadership. This course examines the shifting coalitions arguing over U.S. trade policy, the shifting goals they seek to accomplish via U.S. trade policy, and the international effects of U.S. trade. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives C. Mitchell Prereq: POLIT-116 . POLIT-273  Public Policy  Spring. Credits: 4   Want to change your government for the better? This course is concerned with the practical business of how, focusing on the often invisible and underappreciated public servants who do the hard work of designing, implementing and enforcing the policies and programs on which modern societies depend. Their work is often nonideological, yet modern democracies have long harbored suspicions of the power of unelected bureaucrats. Students in this course will study these debates over the organization and functions of modern state administration, familiarize themselves with policymaking processes, and engage in designing practical solutions to some of the most pressing social issues of the present. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences R. Darrow  POLIT-277  Dislocation: Class and Politics in the U.S.  Spring. Credits: 4   Dislocation from work and home has been a common experience of the working class in the United States since World War II. Whether caused by factors such as the gentrification of urban neighborhoods and rural towns, deindustrialization, urban renewal, automation, or the precarity of low-wage employment, the working class experience of dislocation continues today. This course will examine the decision making behind the policies and practices that have dislocated many working class Americans, as well as how these people have adjusted, accommodated, resisted, and sometimes fought dislocation from their jobs and homes. In this course, class is viewed as a social position shaped by power relations. While race and gender will be taken into account, our main focus will be understanding and explaining the common experience of the working class majority in the U.S. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive P. Smith Prereq: POLIT-104 or POLIT-252 , or 8 credits in Politics. POLIT-278  U.S. Elections  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   Elections are at the core of both the vitality and fragility of American democracy. Free and responsive government is hard to imagine without elections, yet U.S. elections suffer from relatively low turnout, increasing polarization, invisible money, racial and gender inequality, partisan gerrymandering, and new forms of voter disenfranchisement. This course offers students an overview of American elections by placing the November elections in historical and comparative perspective and following their development in real time. Students will also gain on-the-ground experience working in the local community as voter registrants and get-out-the-vote activists in the run-up to the November elections. By then end of the semester, students will have developed an in-depth understanding of the workings of American electoral institutions and behavior as well as transferrable skills for organizing and mobilizing political action.

POLIT-305  International Society  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   An intensive reading course in theories of international society: the idea that states and peoples are or should be linked to each other through a web of shared values and institutions. It focuses on the work of Hedley Bull, Immanuel Kant, and John Rawls. How did these three men understand international society? What are or should be the values and institutions that give rise to it and support it? What implications do their visions of international society have for war and peace, state sovereignty, religion, democracy, capitalism, distributive justice, human rights, and international law? What responses and criticisms have their arguments engendered? Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences S. Hashmi Prereq: POLIT-116 . POLIT-312  Silk Roads: Ancient and Modern Highways across the Eurasian Continent  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   The silk roads were ancient transportation and trade links that wound their way across the Eurasian continent, or by sea through the South China Sea and Indian Ocean, to Europe. They carried silk, glass, jade, and moved religions and literatures across continents. Today, the new silk roads carry oil, gas, drugs, capitalism, and immigrants seeking better lives. We will investigate the parallels between the ancient and modern silk roads and the contemporary strategic, cultural, and economic significance of these new highways, which link China, Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe. Crosslisted as: RES-312 Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences The department Prereq: 8 credits in Politics, International  Relations, History, or Russian and Eurasian studies.

Hashmi Restrictions: This course is open to juniors and seniors  POLIT-327  Transitional Justice  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   As societies emerge from authoritarian rule or civil war, they face the daunting task of engaging past human rights violations. States have a myriad of options at their disposal, ranging from granting blanket amnesties to hosting complex trials and truth commissions. In making these decisions, new leaders face pressures from former authoritarian actors, victims' groups, and international organizations. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses, and the political, legal, economic, and moral ramifications of each choice. Most importantly, it asks--does transitional justice work? Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences A. Reiter Restrictions: This course is open to juniors and seniors Prereq: 8 credits in Politics.

The primary aim of the class is to help students understand and analyze the process of democratic unfolding in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. We will also evaluate China's recent, albeit limited experiments with democratic practices. We will begin by contrasting Western perspectives of democracy with both traditional and more contemporary Asian understandings of democracy. We will then focus on the actual processes of democratic consolidation in each of the cases, especially the developments that precipitated political crisis and ultimately, political change. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives C. Chen Restrictions: This course is open to juniors and seniors  POLIT-363  Political Economy of the European Union  Spring.

Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences K. Khory Restrictions: This course is open to juniors and seniors Prereq: 8 Credits from Politics  POLIT-372  Earthborn Democracy  Fall. Credits: 4   The relationship between ecology and democracy has a complex history and an uncertain future. Ecological crises threaten all forms of life on earth, and democracy too is an endangered species, as popular discontent, elite malfeasance, and unresponsive institutions herald democratic crisis if not collapse. If our present political concepts and institutions are inadequate for meeting the challenges of living in right relation with the more-than-human world, these inadequacies are themselves symptoms of a failing political-cultural story and a lack of concrete practices of ecological renewal. Course readings will excavate political practices and stories illustrating the interdependence necessary to inspire and orient the work of ecological renewal. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive A. Aslam Prereq: 8 Credits from Politics  POLIT-378  Backsliding and Resilience in U.S. Democracy  Fall. Credits: 4   American democracy is in trouble. But when has it not been? Since the election of Donald Trump, observers have increasingly begun to question basic assumptions about the apparent stability of the American constitutional regime. Yet critical observers, activists, and political movements across the past two centuries have persistently called attention to the deficits of U.S. democracy and sought to rectify them. Is America presently at risk of "democratic backsliding"? Or will U.S. democracy prove resilient? This course puts the current distemper of U.S. democracy in historical perspective by examining the complex and contradictory patterns of democratic development from the Founding to the present.

POLIT-387  Advanced Topics in Political Theory      POLIT-387AW  Advanced Topics in Politics: 'Law and Inequality'  Spring. Credits: 4   The gap between the rich and the poor in the United States today is as wide as it was during the Great Depression. Some scholars and lawmakers have called our era the "Second Gilded Age," a reference that evokes images of robber barons and monopolists, the "billionaire class" of yesteryear. This seminar poses the question: what does law have to do with it? Together, we will explore all the ways that "law," "politics," and economics" are messily entwined, and how those entanglements explain who has wealth, who gets healthcare, who goes to jail, and who decides climate change policy. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences Other Attribute(s): Speaking-Intensive, Writing-Intensive J. Wuest Prereq: 8 credits in the department and POLIT-104 . POLIT-387DE  Advanced Topics in Politics: 'Democratic Desire'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   If democracies trace their origins back to insurrections -- whether, to name three, the American, French, or Haitian -- how do we make sense of the near-universal condemnation of January 6th insurrections or of those participating in uprisings in Ferguson, Baltimore, Portland, Seattle, Athens or Madrid over the last decade as threats to democracy? This paradox points to an underdeveloped concept of desire across democratic theory that would explain the basis for the people to rule themselves. This course will explore democratic desire as both the desire not to be ruled by others and the desire for collective self-rule. Beginning with feminists writing about erotic power such as Audre Lorde and the varied practices of so-called "pleasure activists," we will understand the role of desire in politics, how it can be tapped into, why it can be so unruly, and why it is repressed. Tracing desire's anarchic element, our readings will examine "wild democracy" and the polymorphism of desire, as pathways for cultivating a healthy desire for exercising power and cooperating with others through organizing and movement practices. Readings may include titles by Anne Norton, adrienne marie brown, Lama Rod Owens, Norman O. Brown, Bonnie Honig, and Saidiya Hartman.

POLIT-387FX  Advanced Topics in Politics: 'The Feminist Sex Wars'  Spring. Credits: 4   In the late 1970s through the 1980s, a series of contentious debates erupted in American feminism over pornography, prostitution, sadomasochism, and other issues related to sex, power, pleasure, desire, erotic community, and violence. This was a time of prolific theorizing and bitter conflict known as the "feminist sex wars." This course tries to make sense of some common contemporary discourses on pornography, sexual representation, sexual conduct, and sexual ethics by exploring their sources in the feminist political and theoretical debates of the sex wars, as well as examining how feminist engagement with these issues was entangled in larger political, cultural, and philosophical contexts. We will also question how the feminist sex wars are remembered and theorized today and what kind of stories about the feminist sex wars are repeatedly told in different institutional contexts.

Advisory: Strongly recommended that students take POLIT-233 or GNDST-101 before taking this course. POLIT-387HE  Advanced Topics in Politics: 'Health and Inequality'  Fall. Credits: 4   This course is designed to provide students with both an in-depth study of the political and social determinants of health and with queer, feminist, and postcolonial theorizations of health and the body. We will question and theorize what "health" is as well as study how economic and social inequality distribute unequal life chances. We will examine how race, class, gender, sexuality, and citizenship combine to help some survive and even profit from disease and illness while others perish and experience shame, stigma, and financial insecurity. We will study how politicians, scientists, and public health officials have treated different communities and how various marginalized communities have fought back for improved life chances.

POLIT-387PD  Advanced Topics in Politics: 'Other Political Dreams'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   This course examines dreams of other politics, trying to recognize what is distinctive in a diverse set of traditions beyond their resistance to liberal-democracy's entwinement with contemporary capitalism. Spanning anarchism, Afro-pessimism and Afro-futurism, and the #BlackLivesMatter movement, we will examine political actions and thought that do not identify themselves as democratic and even define themselves as anti-democratic in order to name politics they aspire towards. Special attention will be given the picture of collective belonging and action that emerges in these works along with the techniques of figuring these visions and of gathering community around them. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences; Multicultural Perspectives Other Attribute(s): Writing-Intensive A. Aslam Prereq: 8 credits in Politics. POLIT-387PE  Advanced Topics in Politics: 'The 1%'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   In recent years, scholarship on American politics has challenged the idea that our government has upheld and expanded basic democratic principles since the fall of Jim Crow. This scholarship notes a growing wealth gap since the 1970s and 1980s that has given rise to a "New Gilded Age." Along with this rising wealth gap, the United States has also endured rising incarceration rates, a shrinking middle class, an eroding public sphere, and charges that plutocracy -- or governance by the rich -- has overtaken American democracy. In this course we will explore, investigate, and challenge several arguments and assumptions at the heart of these critiques of contemporary US politics. Students will read and discuss cutting edge scholarship and journalism exploring the inequality debates, including inquiries into the complex interrelations of race, gender, and class. Applies to requirement(s): Social Sciences A. Hilton Prereq: 8 credits in Politics including POLIT-104 . POLIT-391  Pivotal Political Ideas      POLIT-391RE  Pivotal Political Ideas: 'Reparations and the Politics of Repair'  Not Scheduled for This Year. Credits: 4   This course will examine arguments for reparations for slavery with an eye towards understanding what withholding and extending reparations have meant for American democracy and citizenship. We will contextualize arguments for reparations within a larger conversation about repairing democratic norms, institutions, and social conditions within recent democratic theory. Together we will investigate what historical and ongoing injustices and inequalities reparations are meant to repair, how reparations would address those harms, and how arguments for reparations have mobilized social activists on both sides of the question. Our readings will span history, legal studies, politics, literature and the arts and arguments for reparations to be paid by the American state down to institutions such as corporations, universities, and other jurisdictions.
