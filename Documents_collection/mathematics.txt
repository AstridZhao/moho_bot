Courses        Course Advice  Beginning the Study of Mathematics  There are many ways to begin the study of the mathematical sciences at Mount Holyoke College. Students can begin with precalculus, calculus, an introduction to statistics or data analysis, an "explorations" course, or computer science. If your interests lie in science, economics, or social sciences, calculus is important because it is the language these disciplines use. Students who are planning to take Precalculus or Calculus I are required to complete a brief online self-assessment. The self-assessment is available to all entering students. It is designed so that a student can use it as a learning tool, taking it as many times as they wish. More information is on the department’s website . Toward the Study of Calculus  If the online self-assessment or your own mathematics background suggests, you should complete a year-long sequence of MATH-100 , followed by MATH-101 . Mount Holyoke's  MATH-100 course (including all of its variants like MATH-100QR ) awards 4 credits and fulfills the Math/Science distribution requirement. Precalculus courses taken outside the Mount Holyoke College MATH-100 / MATH-101 sequence will not be granted credit nor be approved to satisfy any distribution requirement. Beginning with Calculus  If you wish to begin with a calculus course, you can take any of the following:  Course List  Code  Title  Credits  MATH-101 Calculus I 4 MATH-102 Calculus II 4 MATH-203 Calculus III 4 Students who have not studied calculus and who have the necessary precalculus background belong in Calculus I. Most students who have taken calculus in high school begin with Calculus II. In particular, if you have studied the derivative and its applications and have been introduced to the definite integral, you should take the Calculus Assessment to determine if you are ready to move to Calculus II. If you have a good knowledge of applications of integration and of transcendental functions, and if you enjoy mathematics, we encourage you to begin your college-level study of calculus with Calculus III ( MATH-203 ). (The study of series is neither required for nor included in Calculus III. Physics and mathematics students will encounter this topic in later courses.) Beginning the study of calculus beyond Calculus I does not require the advanced placement examination, although the score on this examination is a useful guide. A student with an advanced placement AB score of 3 or less should begin with MATH-101 ; an advanced placement AB score of 4 or 5 or a BC score of 3 indicates readiness for MATH-102 ; a grade of 4 or 5 on the BC examination indicates readiness for MATH-203 . Other Beginnings  “Explorations” courses in areas like number theory and geometry (for example MATH-139 ) offer another way to begin your study of mathematics. They emphasize mathematics as an art and as a way of seeing and understanding. The exploration courses do not presuppose demonstrated ability for or prior strong interest in mathematics. They intend to awaken interest by demonstrating either the remarkable pervasiveness of mathematics in nature and its power as a tool that transcends disciplines, or its qualities as an art that can fascinate and offer aesthetic pleasure to the participant. Any explorations course can serve as an entry to the further study of mathematics, and even to a minor or a major. Students who wish to go on may follow up with the Laboratory in Mathematical Experimentation ( MATH-251 ) or Discrete Mathematics ( MATH-232 ), among various other possibilities, all of which can be discussed with any member of the department. A few students begin their study of mathematics with Linear Algebra ( MATH-211 ), Discrete Mathematics ( MATH-232 ), or the Laboratory in Mathematical Experimentation ( MATH-251 ). Linear Algebra is a good choice for students who have a very solid background in high school mathematics and who enjoy abstraction. If you have taken some calculus, and if you enjoy new topics in mathematics, then you might consider either Discrete Mathematics ( MATH-232 ) or the Laboratory in Mathematical Experimentation ( MATH-251 ). Finally, some students begin their study of mathematical sciences with statistics or computer science. For more information see the sections on statistics and computer science in this catalog. Advice to Students with Special Interests  Actuarial science  Students interested in this area should plan to cover the material that is included in the first two actuarial exams as part of their undergraduate program. This material is included in:  Course List  Code  Title  Credits  MATH-101 Calculus I 4 MATH-102 Calculus II 4 MATH-203 Calculus III 4 MATH-342 Probability 4 STAT-343 Mathematical Statistics 4 ECON-211 Macroeconomic Theory 4 ECON-212 Microeconomic Theory 4 ECON-215 Economics of Corporate Finance 4 Students are also encouraged to obtain experience through an internship. Biostatistics, public health, or natural resources  Students interested in these areas should include substantial work in biology, chemistry, geology, and/or environmental studies in their programs. Economics or business  Many students with these interests design a special major in mathematics and economics or a special major in statistics and economics. Engineering  Students interested in engineering often double major in mathematics and physics and/or participate in one of the College’s five-year, dual-degree programs with Dartmouth’s Thayer School of Engineering, the California Institute of Technology, or the University of Massachusetts (see the Other Degree and Certificate Programs chapter ). Graduate school  Students preparing for graduate school in mathematics or statistics often participate in an undergraduate research program in the summer after the junior year and continue with an honors thesis in the senior year. For students considering graduate work in mathematics, more than the minimum number of courses for the mathematics major is advisable.
