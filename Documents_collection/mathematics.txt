and RequirementsLearning GoalsMajor RequirementsMinor RequirementsCoursesLearning GoalsLearning GoalsWe welcome all students into the Mathematics major, and we aim to create an inclusive, supportive environment for everyone.Mathematics majors will be able to:Clearly communicate mathematical ideas, using language and visual tools appropriate to the audience.Use theoretical and computational skills from both the continuous and discrete domains to understand pure and applied mathematical problems.Ask questions about new methods and applications, learn new techniques, and make new discoveries.Incorporate “big picture” reasoning, including ethics, practicality, and creativity, into mathematical practice.Develop the independence to approach new problems, and the ability to collaborate effectively.Major RequirementsRequirements for the MajorA minimum of 36 creditsCourse ListCodeTitleCreditsMATH-203Calculus III4MATH-211Linear Algebra4MATH-232Discrete

an introduction to statistics or data analysis, an "explorations" course, or computer science.If your interests lie in science, economics, or social sciences, calculus is important because it is the language these disciplines use.Students who are planning to take Precalculus or Calculus I are required to complete a brief online self-assessment.The self-assessment is available to all entering students.It is designed so that a student can use it as a learning tool, taking it as many times as they wish.More information is on thedepartment’s website.Toward the Study of CalculusIf the online self-assessment or your own mathematics background suggests, you should complete a year-long sequence ofMATH-100, followed byMATH-101.Mount Holyoke'sMATH-100course (including all of its variants likeMATH-100QR) awards 4 credits and fulfills the Math/Science distribution requirement.Precalculus courses taken outside the Mount Holyoke CollegeMATH-100/MATH-101sequence will not be granted credit nor be approved to satisfy any distribution requirement.Beginning with CalculusIf you wish to begin with a calculus course, you can take any of the following:Course ListCodeTitleCreditsMATH-101Calculus I4MATH-102Calculus II4MATH-203Calculus III4Students who have not studied calculus and who have the necessary precalculus background belong in Calculus I.Most students who have taken calculus in high school begin with Calculus II.In particular, if you have studied the derivative and its applications and have been introduced to the definite integral, you should take the Calculus Assessment to determine if you are ready to move to Calculus II.If you have a good knowledge of applications of integration and of transcendental functions, and if you enjoy mathematics, we encourage you to begin your college-level study of calculus with Calculus III (MATH-203).(The study of series is neither required for nor included in Calculus III.Physics and mathematics students will encounter this topic in later courses.)Beginning the study of calculus beyond Calculus I does not require the advanced placement examination, although the score on this examination is a useful guide.A student with an advanced placement AB score of 3 or less should begin withMATH-101; an advanced placement AB score of 4 or 5 or a BC score of 3 indicates readiness forMATH-102; a grade of 4 or 5 on the BC examination indicates readiness forMATH-203.Other Beginnings“Explorations” courses in areas like number theory and geometry (for exampleMATH-139) offer another way to begin your study of mathematics.They emphasize mathematics as an art and as a way of seeing and understanding.The exploration courses do not presuppose demonstrated ability for or prior strong interest in mathematics.They intend to awaken interest by demonstrating either the remarkable pervasiveness of mathematics in nature and its power as a tool that transcends disciplines, or its qualities as an art that can fascinate and offer aesthetic pleasure to the participant.Any explorations course can serve as an entry to the further study of mathematics, and even to a minor or a major.Students who wish to go on may follow up with the Laboratory in Mathematical Experimentation (MATH-251) or Discrete Mathematics (MATH-232), among various other possibilities, all of which can be discussed with any member of the department.A few students begin their study of mathematics with Linear Algebra (MATH-211), Discrete Mathematics (MATH-232), or the Laboratory in Mathematical Experimentation (MATH-251).Linear Algebra is a good choice for students who have a very solid background in high school mathematics and who enjoy abstraction.If you have taken some calculus, and if you enjoy new topics in mathematics, then you might consider either Discrete Mathematics (MATH-232) or the Laboratory in Mathematical Experimentation (MATH-251).Finally, some students begin their study of mathematical sciences with statistics or computer science.For more information see the sections onstatisticsandcomputer sciencein this catalog.Advice to Students with Special InterestsActuarial scienceStudents interested in this area should plan to cover the material that is included in the first two actuarial exams as part of their undergraduate program.This material is included in:Course ListCodeTitleCreditsMATH-101Calculus I4MATH-102Calculus II4MATH-203Calculus III4MATH-342Probability4STAT-343Mathematical Statistics4ECON-211Macroeconomic Theory4ECON-212Microeconomic Theory4ECON-215Economics of Corporate Finance4Students are also encouraged to obtain experience through an internship.Biostatistics, public health, or natural resourcesStudents interested in these areas should include substantial work in biology, chemistry, geology, and/or environmental studies in their programs.Economics or businessMany students with these interests design aspecial majorin mathematics and economics or aspecial majorin statistics and economics.EngineeringStudents interested in engineering often double major in mathematics and physics and/or participate in one of the College’s five-year, dual-degree programs with Dartmouth’s Thayer School of Engineering, the California Institute of Technology, or the University of Massachusetts (see theOther Degree and Certificate Programs chapter).Graduate schoolStudents preparing for graduate school in mathematics or statistics often participate in an undergraduate research program in the summer after the junior year and continue with an honors thesis in the senior year.For students considering graduate work in mathematics, more than the minimum number of courses for the mathematics major is advisable.Course OfferingsMATH-100  PrecalculusMATH-100QR  Precalculus: 'Problem Solving and Quantitative Reasoning'Fall.Credits: 4This course is intended for students who, based on the

theory and applications in fields like management, economics, engineering, and computer science that require decision making under constraints on time or other resources.We will begin by studying linear optimization, including duality, the simplex algorithm, and the geometry of linear programming.Other topics will include discrete optimization, network optimization, and nonlinear optimization.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesThe departmentPrereq:MATH-211.MATH-339SP  Topics in Applied Mathematics: 'Stochastic Processes'Spring.Credits: 4Stochastic processes are mathematical models that evolve with time and include an element of randomness.They involve a collection of states-for example, the weather in a geographical location, the size of a population, or the length of a queue-and a description of how the system evolves from one state to the next.This course is devoted to the study of a class of stochastic processes called Markov chains, and we attempt to study their behavior using tools from probability theory and linear algebra in beautiful, interconnected ways.Topics will include Markov chains in discrete and continuous time, branching processes, queuing theory, and Markov chain Monte Carlo.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesT.ChumleyPrereq:MATH-211andMATH-342.MATH-342  ProbabilityFall and Spring.Credits: 4This course develops the ideas
