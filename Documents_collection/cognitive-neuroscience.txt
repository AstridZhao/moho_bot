Faculty Leadership Development ProgramsWomen's Studies Research CenterCognitive Neuroscience ProgramThis program is designed to offer a unique opportunity for undergraduate students in the Five Colleges to deepen their understanding of cognitive neuroscience, through both theoretical and empirical training.BreadcrumbHomeAcademicsCognitive neuroscience is the study of the mind as it is manifested in the human brain.Cognitive neuroscientists combine psychophysical and brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and event-related potentials to examine the brain function underlying cognitive abilities in human beings.This program is designed for students interested in gaining experience within the field of cognitive neuroscience.On This PageFacultyHampshire CollegeJane CouperusCindy GillJoanna MorrisMount Holyoke CollegeKathy BinderMara BreenSmith CollegeMary HarringtonMaryjane WragaCertificate RequirementsThe Five College Certificate in Cognitive Neuroscience is currently available to students enrolled at Hampshire, Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges.To complete the certificate, students must complete at least one course in each of these areas of study:Overview of Cognitive ScienceRationale: A broad outlook of issues related to cognitive neuroscience.Scientific Foundations(Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Biology)Rationale: A greater coverage of a topic supporting the cognitive neuroscience framework.To be determined under the guidance of the student's Cognitive Neuroscience Certificate faculty advisor.It is recommended that this be in an area outside the student's major.Research Methods, Design and AnalysisRationale: The methodological foundation needed to understand, interpret and conduct basic research.Philosophy of MindRationale: The fundamental philosophical insights to the mind-body problem, a key issue in the field of cognitive neuroscience.Neuroscience(Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology)Rationale: The basics in brain anatomy and function.Advanced TopicsRationale: A more in-depth coverage of empirical and theoretical issues central to cognitive processes.Independent ResearchThe student must also complete at least one semester of independent research through a thesis, course project or special study.The course project may be completed in conjunction with one of the classes listed under the Research Methods areas.An adviser approved summer research project would also meet the research requirement.Cognitive Neuroscience Certificate Completion FormCoursesMany courses in addition to those listed below may be appropriate to fulfill the requirements of the Five College Cognitive Neuroscience Certificate.Students are encouraged to consult a Cognitive
