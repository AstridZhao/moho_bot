two different disciplines (see Focus below)128 additional credits in international relations8Total Credits401These introductory courses provide the foundation for more advanced course work in the IR major.Therefore, they should all be completed within the first five semesters at Mount Holyoke.IR-200is intended for IR majors in their sophomore year.2Please note that the Department of Economics requiresECON-110Introductory Economicsas a prerequisite forECON-213andECON-218.3Students with high school preparation in geography should takeGEOG-206.Other RequirementsFocus.Each student’s major must have a focus, consisting of at least 12 credits in two different disciplines, only 4 credits of which may be independent study.Students may elect one of the following five foci: global commons, international institutions, international peace and security, international political economy, or international ethics.They may also design a focus, with the approval of their advisor and the chair.Independent study.Only 4 credits of independent work can count toward the requirement for courses at the 300 level.Foreign language.Each student is expected to possess or acquire intermediate-level or higher proficiency in a foreign language (usually four semesters).Additional SpecificationsSoon after declaring their major, students should plan individual programs of study in consultation with one or more members of the faculty committee, one of whom will be designated the student’s academic advisor.Exceptions to the requirements above will be made only in rare cases and require the approval of the chair.The Department of International Relations does not cross-list courses in other departments that satisfy the major’s requirements.Generally, all courses taught by members of the IR Committee count toward the major.For courses offered by other faculty, the policy of the department is to accept any course in any department that is directly pertinent to the student’s focus in the major.Thus, for example, a student whose focus is global commons could conceivably count courses offered by the geology or biological sciences departments.Or a student focusing on international ethics could use certain courses in the religion or philosophy departments to satisfy the requirements of the major.Any questions concerning the appropriateness of a particular course can be answered by the advisor or the department chair.It is important for the student to verify that the course in question will count toward the major before enrolling.The IR major focuses on global issues and institutions, and relationships across regions and nations.This does not preclude students from developing expertise in a particular region or nation; indeed, part of the study of international relations is how global issues find local expressions.But students whose primary interest is in a particular area of the world should elect a more appropriate major, such as Latin American or Asian studies.Students who declare an international relations major automatically fulfill the College's "outside the major" requirement.Certificate RequirementsCertificate OverviewThe Five
