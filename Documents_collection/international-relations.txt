Studying international relations will help you develop a global perspective on the origins of the current international system, current issues that transcend national boundaries, and the emerging challenges humanity will face in the years ahead. International Relations Faculty    Research           Program Overview    The International Relations major is broad-ranging and versatile. It covers such topics as foreign policy, international political economy, the environment, and international law. As an international relations major you will complete a course of study that includes introductory core courses in economics, geography, history, and politics, as well as a course in research methods. More advanced coursework is done in one of five focus fields: global commons, international institutions, international peace and security, international political economy, and international ethics. The Five College Certificate in International Relations serves as the minor in International Relations. We encourage you to attain a level of proficiency in a foreign language that will allow you to do basic research in it. International Experience for International Careers  Careers in an increasingly globalized world require the ability to navigate a fast-paced environment that spans state borders. We encourage you to study abroad and pursue internships that will expose you to different cultures and languages and to obtain the skills needed to continue to succeed beyond Mount Holyoke. International Relations graduates have many options. Our graduates have gone on to have distinguished careers in government, academia, business, law, journalism, and the non-profit realm. Many have earned master's, doctoral, or law degrees along the way.

Major Requirements        Requirements for the Major  A minimum of 40 credits:  Course List  Code  Title  Credits  ECON-213 Economic Development 4 or ECON-218 International Economics GEOG-105 World Regional Geography 1, 3 4 or GEOG-206 Political Geography HIST-151 Modern and Contemporary Europe 1 4 or HIST-161 British Empire and Commonwealth POLIT-116 World Politics 1 4 IR-200 Research Methods 1 4 At least 12 credits at the 300 level in two different disciplines (see Focus below) 12 8 additional credits in international relations 8 Total Credits 40  1 These introductory courses provide the foundation for more advanced course work in the IR major. Therefore, they should all be completed within the first five semesters at Mount Holyoke. IR-200 is intended for IR majors in their sophomore year. 2 Please note that the Department of Economics requires ECON-110 Introductory Economics as a prerequisite for ECON-213 and ECON-218 . 3 Students with high school preparation in geography should take GEOG-206 . Other Requirements  Focus. Each student’s major must have a focus, consisting of at least 12 credits in two different disciplines, only 4 credits of which may be independent study. Students may elect one of the following five foci: global commons, international institutions, international peace and security, international political economy, or international ethics. They may also design a focus, with the approval of their advisor and the chair. Independent study. Only 4 credits of independent work can count toward the requirement for courses at the 300 level. Foreign language. Each student is expected to possess or acquire intermediate-level or higher proficiency in a foreign language (usually four semesters). Additional Specifications  Soon after declaring their major, students should plan individual programs of study in consultation with one or more members of the faculty committee, one of whom will be designated the student’s academic advisor. Exceptions to the requirements above will be made only in rare cases and require the approval of the chair. The Department of International Relations does not cross-list courses in other departments that satisfy the major’s requirements. Generally, all courses taught by members of the IR Committee count toward the major. For courses offered by other faculty, the policy of the department is to accept any course in any department that is directly pertinent to the student’s focus in the major. Thus, for example, a student whose focus is global commons could conceivably count courses offered by the geology or biological sciences departments. Or a student focusing on international ethics could use certain courses in the religion or philosophy departments to satisfy the requirements of the major. Any questions concerning the appropriateness of a particular course can be answered by the advisor or the department chair. It is important for the student to verify that the course in question will count toward the major before enrolling. The IR major focuses on global issues and institutions, and relationships across regions and nations. This does not preclude students from developing expertise in a particular region or nation; indeed, part of the study of international relations is how global issues find local expressions. But students whose primary interest is in a particular area of the world should elect a more appropriate major, such as Latin American or Asian studies. Students who declare an international relations major automatically fulfill the College's "outside the major" requirement.
