K. SamadarBreadcrumbHomeAcademicsLogic is a part of every discipline.There is reasoning in every field of inquiry.There are rules behind every work of art, behind every natural language.There is inference in every intelligence, human and inhuman.Every issue of law and public policy bends to the power of logic.The study of logic itself is thus of the greatest importance.The Logic Certificate Program brings together aspects of logic from different regions of the curriculum: philosophy, mathematics, computer science and linguistics.The program is designed to acquaint students with the uses of logic and initiate them in the profound mysteries and discoveries of modern logic.On This PageFacultyAmherst CollegeMichael Ching, Mathematics and StatisticsAlexander George, PhilosophyHampshire CollegeLee Spector, Cognitive Science, Computer ScienceMount Holyoke CollegeG.Lee Bowie, Philosophy (Emeritus)Samuel Mitchell, PhilosophySmith CollegeJay Garfield, PhilosophyTheresa Helke, PhilosophyAlbert Mosley, Philosophy (Emeritus)Melissa Yates, PhilosophyUMass AmherstPhillip Bricker, PhilosophyGary Hardegree, PhilosophyNeil Immerman, Computer ScienceKevin Klement, PhilosophyAngelika Kratzer,LinguisticsBarbara Partee, Linguistics and Philosophy (Emerita)Alejandro Pérez Carballo, PhilosophyCertificate RequirementsThe basic requirement for the logic certificate is six courses from the list of Five College logic courses.For more details, please review the Five College Logic Certificate Program Completion Form (below).No more than four courses can be counted toward the certificate from any single discipline (philosophy, linguistics, mathematics, computer science).At least two courses must be taken at an advanced level (500 or above at UMass, 300 or above at Smith, Hampshire, Mt.Holyoke or Amherst).At least one course should expose students to the basic metatheory of first-order logic including incompleteness.Courses satisfying this requirement include:Smith: Philosophy 220Amherst: Math 385, Computer Science 121, 351UMass Amherst: Philosophy 513, 514Mount Holyoke: Philosophy 327Students must receive grades of at least "B" in each course counting toward the certificate.Logic Certificate Completion FormCoursesNote that if you don't see classes from all campuses currently listed, they will appear as the campuses release their course schedules for the semester.The five campuses release their schedules on different dates.Visit this pagefor specific dates.Spring 2024 Logic CoursesSubjectCourse #Sect #Course TitleInstructor(s)InstitutionMeeting TimesMATH38501Mathematical LogicNathan PfluegerAmherst CollegeM/W/F | 1:00 PM -
