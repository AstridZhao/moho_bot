I will tell you: In every corner of the known universe, you will find either the presence of logical arguments or, more significantly, the absence.”  — V. K. Samadar      Breadcrumb    Home    Academics             Logic is a part of every discipline. There is reasoning in every field of inquiry. There are rules behind every work of art, behind every natural language. There is inference in every intelligence, human and inhuman. Every issue of law and public policy bends to the power of logic.  The study of logic itself is thus of the greatest importance. The Logic Certificate Program brings together aspects of logic from different regions of the curriculum: philosophy, mathematics, computer science and linguistics. The program is designed to acquaint students with the uses of logic and initiate them in the profound mysteries and discoveries of modern logic.

For more details, please review the Five College Logic Certificate Program Completion Form (below).  No more than four courses can be counted toward the certificate from any single discipline (philosophy, linguistics, mathematics, computer science).  At least two courses must be taken at an advanced level (500 or above at UMass, 300 or above at Smith, Hampshire, Mt. Holyoke or Amherst).  At least one course should expose students to the basic metatheory of first-order logic including incompleteness. Courses satisfying this requirement include:  Smith: Philosophy 220 Amherst: Math 385, Computer Science 121, 351 UMass Amherst: Philosophy 513, 514 Mount Holyoke: Philosophy 327  Students must receive grades of at least "B" in each course counting toward the certificate.
