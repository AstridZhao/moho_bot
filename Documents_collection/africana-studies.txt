Africans and people of African descent to move forward in their societies, often against overwhelming odds, is one of the most compelling areas of inquiry ...Africana Studies FacultyProgram OverviewAs a field of inquiry, Africana Studies describes and analyzes the origins and experiences of people of African descent wherever they live or have lived.This field is informed by the intellectual traditions of African American, African and African Diasporic studies.While it has a renewed focus on the connections and movements of African descended people from different sites of Africa and the diaspora, it also values in-depth study of Black people in discrete local, regional and national contexts.This field is inherently comparative, international, and interdisciplinary in approach.It is vital to embrace the range of fields in the humanities and social sciences-including the performing arts.Program InformationProgram TypeMinorDepartmentDepartment of Africana StudiesCommunity
