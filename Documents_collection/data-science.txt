Search                      Academics    Find Your Program   Data Science       Data Science  Undergraduate   Data science extracts meaningful knowledge from large amounts of complex data by using scientific methods, statistics and computing tools. The Data Science Committee           Program Overview    The data science major lives at the intersection of many fields. Cross-disciplinary by definition, this major is an exercise in integration, one that brings together technical skills and domain-specific knowledge to create new pathways for learning. The data science major will prepare you to face emerging questions and challenges in the communication of data concepts and outcomes. Offering rigorous training in statistics and computer science, the major emphasizes how to be an effective, ethical and judicious consumer of data. The major offers a foundational understanding of the data generating process, the appropriate and efficient translation of analytic strategies to specific data settings, the potential biases arising from missing data or data collection, the means for drawing accurate conclusions, and the techniques and principles of integrity in data visualization and communication. As part of your data science education, you will develop excellent communication skills and the ability to make clear and persuasive arguments framed by logic and supported by data. The curriculum is flexible and innovative, serving a diverse backgrounds and disciplinary interests, and deep enough to accommodate anyone who wants ultimately to pursue advanced study in statistics and computer science. The Data Science curriculum reflects the increasingly collaborative and interdisciplinary academic landscape.

Students are encouraged to plan their elective courses early in order to ensure that they meet the requirements to access chosen courses. 4 Students are strongly encouraged to take an elective course in ethics. 5 Other courses that focus on ethics, cover data analytic methods, or involve an independent project with data can be substituted with approval of the Data Science Program Committee. 6 Students intending to attend graduate school in data science are advised to take both of these courses. 7 COMSC-335 Machine Learning requires MATH-232 as a prerequisite. Additional Specifications   Students who declare a Data Science major automatically fulfill the College's "outside the major" requirement. Courses        Course Advice  Students Considering a Major in Data Science  Data science is new and evolving; there are many important combinations of theoretical, applied, and field-specific knowledge that may provide a foundation for future work. If you are interested in a data science major, we recommend that you work with your advisor to choose a set of related courses that reflect your interests and priorities from the list of electives. Course combinations that focus on individual topics, disciplines, or domains are strongly recommended. We also strongly recommend substantial engagement with issues of ethics, which could be in one focused course or across multiple courses. Students Considering Graduate School or a Career as a Data Scientist:  While there are many fields for which the combination of data analysis and computational tools may be valuable, we have particular recommendations for students seeking a future as a data scientist. We strongly recommend that you take both COMSC-335 Machine Learning and STAT-340 Applied Regression Methods . Ideally, at least one course should involve an extended project requiring the analysis of data. We also recommend that you contextualize your data science preparation in the content of a domain or area of study that is theoretically and empirically cohesive. Course Offerings  On This Page Required Core Courses for the Data Science Major Elective Courses for the Data Science Major    DATA-113  Introduction to Data Science  Fall and Spring. Credits: 4   Data scientists answer questions with scientific and social relevance using statistical theory and computation. We will discuss elementary topics in statistics and learn how to write code (in Python) to visualize data and perform simulations. We will use these tools to answer questions about real data sets. We will also explore ethical issues faced by data scientists today. Applies to requirement(s): Math  Sciences K. Mulder, L. Tupper  DATA-225  Topics in Data Science:      DATA-225AR  Topics in Data Science 'Ethics and Artificial Intelligence'  Spring. Credits: 4   Artificially intelligent technologies are prominent features of modern life -- as are ethical concerns about their programming and use. In this class we will use the tools of philosophy to explore and critically evaluate ethical issues raised by current and future AI technologies. Topics may include issues of privacy and transparency in online data collection, concerns about social justice in the use of algorithms in areas like hiring and criminal justice, and the goals of developing general versus special purpose AI. We will also look at ethics for AI: the nature of AI 'minds,' the possibility of creating more ethical AI systems, and when and if AIs themselves might deserve moral rights.

Credits: 1 - 4    The department Instructor permission required. DATA-390  Data Science Capstone  Fall and Spring. Credits: 4   The Capstone is a research seminar that brings together the three pillars of the Data Science curriculum. The course will start with common readings about research projects across a range of disciplines, including readings that address issues of ethics involved with the collection, treatment, and analysis of data. Concurrently, each student will develop an individual research topic and identify relevant data resources. The remainder of the term will be dedicated to exploring these topics through extensive data analysis, visualization, and interpretation, leading to a final report with complete results and a presentation. Applies to requirement(s): Math  Sciences K. Mulder Prereq: COMSC-205 and STAT-340 . STAT-340 may be taken concurrently (contact instructor for permission).
