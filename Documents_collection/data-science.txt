meaningful knowledge from large amounts of complex data by using scientific methods, statistics and computing tools.The Data Science CommitteeProgram OverviewThe data science major lives at the intersection of many fields.Cross-disciplinary by definition, this major is an exercise in integration, one that brings together technical skills and domain-specific knowledge to create new pathways for learning.The data science major will prepare you to face emerging questions and challenges in the communication of data concepts and outcomes.Offering rigorous training in statistics and computer science, the major emphasizes how to be an effective, ethical and judicious consumer of data.The major offers a foundational understanding of the data generating process, the appropriate and efficient translation of analytic strategies to specific data settings, the potential biases arising from missing data or data collection, the means for drawing accurate conclusions, and the techniques and principles of integrity in data visualization and communication.As part of your data science education, you will develop excellent communication skills and the ability to make clear and persuasive arguments framed by logic and supported by data.The curriculum is flexible and innovative, serving a diverse backgrounds and disciplinary interests, and deep enough to accommodate anyone who wants ultimately to pursue advanced study in statistics and computer science.The Data Science curriculum reflects the increasingly collaborative and interdisciplinary academic landscape.Program InformationProgram TypeMajorOutcomeBachelor of ArtsDepartmentThe Data Science CommitteeCourses and RequirementsCulminating in an integrative capstone and data ethics course, the data science

other 300-level courses from this list, one of which is from a department other than their COMSC-335/STAT-340 choice.3Many elective courses require prerequisites.Students are encouraged to plan their elective courses early in order to ensure that they meet the requirements to access chosen courses.4Students are strongly encouraged to take an elective course in ethics.5Other courses that focus on ethics, cover data analytic methods, or involve an independent project with data can be substituted with approval of the Data Science Program Committee.6Students intending to attend graduate school in data science are advised to take both of these courses.7COMSC-335Machine LearningrequiresMATH-232as a prerequisite.Additional SpecificationsStudents who declare a Data Science major automatically fulfill the College's "outside the major" requirement.CoursesCourse AdviceStudents Considering a Major in Data ScienceData science is new and evolving; there are many important combinations of theoretical, applied, and field-specific knowledge that may provide a foundation for future work.If you are interested in a data science major, we recommend that you work with your advisor to choose a set of related courses that reflect your interests and priorities from the list of electives.Course combinations that focus on individual topics, disciplines, or domains are strongly recommended.We also strongly recommend substantial engagement with issues of ethics, which could be in one focused course or across multiple courses.Students Considering Graduate School or a Career as a Data Scientist:While there are many fields for which the combination of data analysis and computational tools may be valuable, we have particular recommendations for students seeking a future as a data scientist.We strongly recommend that you take bothCOMSC-335Machine LearningandSTAT-340Applied Regression Methods.Ideally, at least one course should involve an extended project requiring the analysis of data.We also recommend that you contextualize your data science preparation in the content of a domain or area of study that is theoretically and empirically cohesive.Course OfferingsOn This PageRequired Core Courses for the Data Science MajorElective Courses for the Data Science MajorDATA-113  Introduction to Data ScienceFall and Spring.Credits: 4Data scientists answer questions with scientific and social relevance using statistical theory and computation.We will discuss elementary topics in statistics and learn how to write code (in Python) to visualize data and perform simulations.We will use these tools to answer questions about real data sets.We will also explore ethical issues faced by data scientists today.Applies to requirement(s): Math  SciencesK.Mulder, L. TupperDATA-225  Topics in Data Science:DATA-225AR  Topics in Data Science 'Ethics and Artificial Intelligence'Spring.Credits: 4Artificially intelligent technologies are prominent features of modern life -- as are ethical concerns about their programming and use.In this class we will use the tools of philosophy to explore and critically evaluate ethical issues raised by current and future AI technologies.Topics may include issues of privacy and transparency in online data collection, concerns about social justice in the use of algorithms in areas like hiring and criminal justice, and the goals of developing general versus special purpose AI.We will also look at ethics for AI: the nature of AI 'minds,' the possibility of creating more ethical AI systems, and when and if AIs themselves might deserve moral rights.Crosslisted as:PHIL-260AR,EOS-299ARApplies to requirement(s): HumanitiesOther Attribute(s): Writing-IntensiveL.SizerDATA-295  Independent StudyFall and Spring.Credits: 1 -
