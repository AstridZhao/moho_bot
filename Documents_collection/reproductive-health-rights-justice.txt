introduce students to thinking intersectionally about reproductive issues, for example, how gender, race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, disability and nationality intersect to shape women’s experiences of reproductive oppression, and their resistance strategies; and teach students to think systemically about reproductive issues, rather than just individually, that is, about the impact of reproductive politics not only on individuals, but also on communities, and how social, economic, legal and political conditions impact reproduction.The material may be covered through any disciplinary or interdisciplinary lens, including history, sociology, legal studies, public policy, women, gender and sexuality studies, political science, journalism, religious studies, American studies, transnational studies, etc.Atransnational/global coursehas 25% reproductive health, rights, and justice content, as defined above, with a transnational/global (i.e.non-U.S.) focus.Anadditionalcourse has 25% reproductive health, rights, and justice content, as defined above.Note that if you don't see classes from all campuses currently listed, they will appear as the campuses release their course schedules for the semester.The five campuses release their schedules on different dates.Visit this pagefor specific dates.Spring 2024 RHRJ Courses: FoundationalSubjectCourse #Sect #Course TitleInstructor(s)InstitutionMeeting TimesBLST30901Island BodiesJallicia JollyAmherst CollegeTU/TH | 1:00 PM - 2:20 PMCSI02251Reproductive JusticeJina FastHampshire College10:30AM-11:50AM TU;10:30AM-11:50AM THNS02241Sexual/Repro Health & TechCory GatrallHampshire College09:00AM-10:20AM W;09:00AM-10:20AM FBIOL321PR01Pregnancy and the PlacentaSarah BaconMount Holyoke CollegeTTH 09:00AM-10:15AMSOC23201World PopulationLeslie L.
