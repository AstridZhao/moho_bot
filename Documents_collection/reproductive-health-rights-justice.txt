The field also includes study of the history of social movements for reproductive empowerment, including the movements for women's liberation, disability rights, racial justice, economic justice, LGBTQ rights, immigrant rights, and the women's health, reproductive freedom, and reproductive justice movements.  By taking six courses across a range of disciplines and completing a special final project, RHRJ certificate graduates are prepared for graduate school, as well as careers in law, science, medicine, health, politics, social work, and community organizing.             Information Session    Every semester the RHRJ Certificate holds an information and advising session via zoom for interested Five College students. The next information and advising session will be Wednesday, November 1, 2023 at noon.

No course may satisfy more than one certificate distribution requirement (i.e. one course cannot count as both a foundational AND transnational/global course).  Courses counted toward satisfaction of campus-based major, minor or another Five College Certificate’s requirements may also be counted toward the RHRJ Certificate.  Courses may be in-person, on-line, hybrid, taken during any time of year, and must be 3-credits or more  Types of Courses that Count:  Courses must be from the approved RHRJ Certificate course list OR be a non-listed course that is approved by the student’s RHRJ Certificate advisor as counting toward the Certificate because the course meets the below category standards. Examples of non-listed courses that may count toward the Certificate with advisor approval:  Study abroad courses  Courses from other colleges/universities  Five College courses that are enhanced with additional RHRJ content / assignments  Evaluation of Non-Listed Courses:  Students should provide their advisor with (1) a short paragraph explaining why they believe the course meets the Certificate requirements and (2) a copy of the syllabus and relevant completed assignments (if possible).   Course Category Descriptions  A  foundational course has 90–100% reproductive health, rights, and justice content, as reflected in the course title and description. Foundational courses introduce students to reproductive politics, including the reproductive health, rights and justice frameworks; introduce students to thinking intersectionally about reproductive issues, for example, how gender, race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, disability and nationality intersect to shape women’s experiences of reproductive oppression, and their resistance strategies; and teach students to think systemically about reproductive issues, rather than just individually, that is, about the impact of reproductive politics not only on individuals, but also on communities, and how social, economic, legal and political conditions impact reproduction. The material may be covered through any disciplinary or interdisciplinary lens, including history, sociology, legal studies, public policy, women, gender and sexuality studies, political science, journalism, religious studies, American studies, transnational studies, etc.  A  transnational/global course  has 25% reproductive health, rights, and justice content, as defined above, with a transnational/global (i.e. non-U.S.) focus.  An  additional course has 25% reproductive health, rights, and justice content, as defined above.  Note that if you don't see classes from all campuses currently listed, they will appear as the campuses release their course schedules for the semester. The five campuses release their schedules on different dates. Visit this page for specific dates.
